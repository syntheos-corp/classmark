All rights reserved.

IMPORTANT — READ CAREFULLY: This license grants limited rights to use the
Licensed Materials solely for non-commercial academic and scientific research.
Any other use requires a separate commercial license from Syntheos, Inc.

1. Definitions
1.1 “Licensor” means Syntheos, Inc.
1.2 “Licensed Materials” means the software, source code, object code,
     models, data files, documentation, and other materials distributed by
     Licensor under this license.
1.3 “Research Institution” means (a) an accredited not-for-profit
     university or college, or (b) a not-for-profit research organization
     whose primary mission is academic or scientific research, each acting
     through its employees, students, or bona fide affiliates.
1.4 “Non-Commercial Academic Research” means research activities conducted
     by or on behalf of a Research Institution for the purpose of advancing
     knowledge, teaching, or scholarship, where no fee is received for use
     of the Licensed Materials and the results are not used to develop,
     market, or provide a product or service offered for consideration.
     Non-Commercial Academic Research expressly excludes:
     (i) any use by or for a for-profit entity (including use under a
         sponsored research, consulting, contract, or service agreement);
     (ii) government or industry-funded research performed under an
         agreement that conveys commercial rights or deliverables; and
     (iii) internal business operations, productization, or deployment in
         any production or customer-facing environment.

2. Grant of Rights
2.1 Research License. Subject to your compliance with this license, Licensor
     grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free
     license to use, reproduce, modify, and create derivative works of the
     Licensed Materials solely for Non-Commercial Academic Research within
     your Research Institution.
2.2 Internal Redistribution within Research Institutions. You may internally
     distribute the Licensed Materials and your derivative works (collectively,
     “Works”) within your Research Institution, including to your Institution’s
     employees, faculty, enrolled students, and bona fide research affiliates
     or collaborators who are working under your Institution’s supervision and
     who are bound in writing to terms no less protective than this license.
     External redistribution outside your Research Institution is prohibited,
     except as permitted by Section 3 (Publications).
2.3 No Sublicensing. Except as expressly allowed in Section 2.2, you may not
     sublicense, assign, transfer, or otherwise provide the Licensed Materials
     or Works to any third party.

3. Publications, Data, and Results
3.1 Publications. You may publish academic papers, preprints, and presentations
     describing your research that uses the Licensed Materials. You must provide
     attribution to “Syntheos, Inc.” and identify the Licensed Materials by name
     and version in any such publication.
3.2 Released Artifacts. You may share research outputs that are not the Licensed
     Materials themselves—such as trained weights, evaluation results, or code
     snippets that are inseparable from the paper—only if such sharing does not
     enable use of substantial portions of the Licensed Materials and is allowed
     by applicable third-party terms. Any released artifacts must include a
     notice that commercial use requires a commercial license from Licensor.

4. Commercial and Other Prohibited Uses
4.1 Prohibited Uses. Without a separate written commercial license from Licensor,
     you may not:
     (a) use the Licensed Materials or Works for any commercial, governmental,
         or for-profit purpose (including paid consulting, contract research,
         fee-for-service, or internal business operations);
     (b) use, host, or deploy the Licensed Materials or Works in any production,
         customer-facing, or revenue-generating system or service;
     (c) provide services to any third party where the Licensed Materials or Works
         are used in performing such services; or
     (d) redistribute the Licensed Materials or Works outside your Research
         Institution, including posting source or binaries to public repositories.
4.2 Commercial Licensing. For uses outside the scope of Section 2, contact:
     info@syntheos.io (or the then-current contact listed by Licensor).

5. Intellectual Property; Patents; Trademarks

     Licensed Materials and all intellectual property rights therein, subject
     only to the limited rights expressly granted in this license.
5.2 Research-Limited Patent License. For the term of this license, Licensor
     grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, royalty-free
     license under Licensor’s patents that read on the Licensed Materials,
     solely to use the Licensed Materials for Non-Commercial Academic Research
     as permitted in Section 2. No patent license is granted for any other use.
5.3 Trademarks. This license does not grant permission to use Licensor’s names,
     logos, or trademarks, except as required for reasonable academic citation.

6. Third-Party Materials
     The Licensed Materials may include or link to third-party components
     subject to separate terms. You are responsible for complying with all
     applicable third-party licenses. In the event of a conflict, the more
     restrictive terms control with respect to the applicable component.

7. Compliance; Records; Audit
7.1 Compliance. You will ensure that all users within your Research Institution
     who access the Licensed Materials are aware of and comply with this license.
7.2 Records. You will maintain reasonable records sufficient to demonstrate
     compliance with this license.
7.3 Audit. Upon at least ten (10) business days’ notice, Licensor may request
     a good-faith discussion to verify compliance. If material non-compliance is
     identified, you will promptly cure it or obtain a commercial license.

8. Warranty Disclaimer
     THE LICENSED MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITHOUT
     WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY,
     OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTIES OF

     NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR
     USAGE OF TRADE. YOUR USE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.

9. Limitation of Liability
     TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR OR ITS
     SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
     EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA,
     OR GOODWILL, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. LICENSOR’S
     TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE SHALL NOT EXCEED
     ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (US$100).

     and continues until terminated as set forth herein.

     5, 6, 8, 9, 10.3, and 11 survive termination.

11. General
11.1 No Waiver; Severability. Failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver.
     If any provision is held unenforceable, it will be modified to the minimum
     extent necessary to be enforceable, and the remainder will remain in effect.
