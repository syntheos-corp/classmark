A Neo-Leitesian, Psycho-Cultural Analysis of Chinese Movies
Mie Augier & Jerry Guo
This is a draft - for discussion with AWM and AM - do not circulate etc
"The ways in which movies pattern the expression of impulses such as
those of hostility which are strongly interfered with in real life can yield
many clues to an understanding of the culture in which the movies are
produced. There are many different ways of interfering with the all-out
hostility, which would make social life impossible. These ways of
repressing or rechanneling hostility will depend on the image of what
would happen if hostility were fully unleashed. Movies show us what
some of these images are" (Wolfenstein & Leites, 1950, p. 306).

0. ABSTRACT AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
"The scope of Nathan's accomplishments includes not only the work on the Soviet Union
...
but also his work toward the end of. his life on theological trends on the last 150 years
and the elaboration of some conjectures concerning the life of Michelangelo. Early on, one
of the more interesting and rewarding of Nathan's products was his book with Martha
Wolfenstein on the movies. This delightful work, more accessible than most of Nathan's
writings, had for me a double reward. The first was its intellectually fascinating
comparative analysis of the themes and the contrasting archetypical characters in ...
movies. Second, because of his analytical structure that one now carried around in one's
head, even poor movies were made interesting"
- Andrew Marshall, 1988, p. 29-30
This is the preliminary result of the ongoing research and analysis, trying to apply some
of the ideas and frameworks in Nathan Leites' approach to understanding other cultures,
countries, and organizations - in this case, focusing on some themes and trends in
Chinese films. An 'application' of Leites"ideas could have focused on trying to apply one
of his works on the Soviet-style approach to the Chinese context, but Marshall suggested
early on to focus first on the topic of movies - to see how the categories and themes
discussed in Leites' movie analysis do (or do not) fit Chinese films (a quick summary
illustration is in the table below), and try and find some preliminary patterns and how
they may reflect issues in Chinese society. At first, 100 modern Chinese films were
watched; summaries are included. This present report is an attempt to extend this analysis
to also include a) older Chinese films and:b) references to modern western ones, as
suggested during discussions with Marshall, to try and understand and illustrate the
continuing relevance of Leites' work and ideas.
.
oversight over the film process from script-writing to the final cut. Examining themes that
exist - and themes that do not exist - can help us understand messages the Chinese
government want the people to see. At the very least, all themes reflected in films are
neutral to the interests of the Party or the government, while at best they reflect the ideals
of what the Chinese government hope for the people to believe.
Sample
We examine 121 Chinese films from 1935-2012; covering the whole span of the Chinese
film industry. Films were selected for their cultural and historical significance (in the case
of early films, as judged by Chinese film scholars), as well as for their total viewership.
We hoped to identify films that most Chinese watched or would watch, so as to maximize
their value in our analysis.
Broad Themes
Although a full description of themes is not possible in this space, we provide some
insights from our analysis here.
First, revolution as a means of social change is a repeated theme across all periods of
film. Leftist and Communist films in the early film period suggest that the ills of society
are best cured by a total transformation - a revolution. This continues through the 20th
century, as the Communist Party justifies the revolutionary periods after the rise of the
Party, and even suggests that future revolution may be necessary.
Much revolution is directed against foreigners, or Chinese parroting foreign interests.
Foreigners are not to be trusted in Chinese film; westerners particularly are shown as
greedy, evil, and rapacious, with interests, tetally contrary to those of the Chinese people.
Foreigners are shown as needing to be removed from China, and that China should be left
for the Chinese.
Authority, and strong authority, is thought of as a stabilizing force that fights against
chaos. China is portrayed as being so large and unruly, with such a large population, that
it requires high authority to be stable. Corruption is a problem for authority, but
corrupting influences are commonly capitalism or foreign influence. Sacrifice and duty on
the behalf of revolution or authority is viewed as noble and necessary.
Social norms are portrayed as changing rapidly as China has opened up and modernized.
Film is ambivalent about modernization, there appear to be great benefits in raising
quality of life, but detrimental effects as well, such as conflicts between individual
obligations to work and obligations to family. Many characters across films are portrayed
as trying to cope with a new world. Capitalism, in Chinese film, is a double-edged sword.
Relation with modern China
How does this analysis shed light on issues facing modern China?

Also included, as appendixes, are a list of some further readings into the areas of using
movies to understand society, as well as a mini review of John Weaklands' work in the
area. Both indicate possible extensions to the' present analysis. As Marshall mentions in
the quote above, Leites' work on movies is fascinating not just because it opens an
important window into understanding a society's values and dynamics; but also because it
makes even not too interesting films worth seeing (and even for people not terribly
fascinated with movies to begin with!).
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Introduction
Throughout his career, Nathan Leites did significant work examining mass psychology
and how it manifested in leadership and management styles. Leites captured the "spirit of
the ruling class" through his work in operational code analysis and his extensive
examinations of Soviet style in warfare and management. His work was not limited,
however, to the elite. His book with Martha Wolfenstein, Movies, examined themes and
characters in American films, and provided a comparative psycho-cultural analysis of
American, British, and French film.
In this study, we take a "Leitesian" approach to studying Chinese film. We examine over
100 Chinese films from 1934 through'2012 The rise of China is one of the most
to the !
interesting and challenging problems of the 21 f.century. How will China manage its
rise? How has China's rise affected the Chinese people? How will China's rise affect its
relations with its neighbors and other world powers? We believe a psycho-cultural
approach, examining China's cultural artifacts, will help shed light on some aspects of
these questions, as well as open research directions to help students of China's rise better
understand what the future might bring.
The Psycho-Cultural Approach
Why a psycho-cultural approach? We view psycho-cultural analysis as an important part
of the analyst's toolkit. Psycho-cultural analysis aims to capture the spirit of another
culture, as informed by psychological analyses of cultural, historical, social, and political
artifacts. The objective is to understand a society, to understand how it functions, what is
culturally and psychologically important, what motivates individuals and collectives, and
how leaders and followers interact. The approach blends aspects of sociological and
psychoanalytical techniques to understand the underlying spirit of the society. Nathan
Leites, in his many works examining Soviet and other Communist societies, was a
pioneer of this approach.
Leites' most widely known works involve detailed analyses of Soviet leadership groups.
His monographs, The Operational Code of the Politburo, Soviet Style in War, and Soviet
Style in Management provided insight into not just how the Soviet leadership thought
about problems, but how they went about addressing them. His early work spawned an
entire field of operational code analyses, although the modern work focuses primarily on
.
psychological profiles of political leaders following George's (1969) re-invention of
operational code methodology.
By turning back to the original thinking behind psycho-cultural analysis, and focusing on
a Leitesian style of analysis, we hope to shed light on change in Chinese society. We
believe this has security implications. China faces a number of challenges as its economy
matures. Chinese leaders will need to decide how to address both external and internal
challenges. Chinese society, more broadly, plays a role in bringing some challenges to
leadership attention, and then reacting to leadership initiatives. If, as students of China's
rise, we hope to understand how China will manage its rise and what it will address,
considering psycho-cultural artificats can help shed light on the spirit of Chinese society.
What are Chinese people concerned with? What stirs emotions? What motivates them to
work together, and what motivates them to stay independent? These questions might be
answered, in part, by performing a Leitesian analysis of Chinese society.
These questions have obvious defense implications Although China's government is
democratic, it is still beholden to the broad masses of society - both in spirit as a
purportedly Communist entity - and in practice as needing broad societal support for
legitimacy. What is represented in Chinese psycho-cultural artificats affects and is
affected by government action. One aspect of understanding the future of Chinese
government plans within China and in East Asia more generally might be to
understanding the psycho-cultural factors entering decision-making.
Film as Cultural Artifact
Is film one such psycho-cultural artifact? We believe it is. Leites and Wolfenstein
conducted a book-length study of American, British, and French film in the first half of
the 20th
century. They suggested that society expresses itself in all aspects of life, and
film is one important cultural component. Film expresses social and cultural values,
beliefs, and emotions, as well as, as a surface-level, a broad description of the themes,
characters, and plots that inhabit daily life: Film is an abstraction of life, and it can be
considered one way of better understanding Chinese society.
Chinese film is a particularly relevant for understanding society. We believe Chinese film
contributes to our understanding at two levels.
First, Chinese film can help describe many of the societal facets we have mentioned.
Themes and plots from film are reflections or mirrors of not just daily life, but the
aspirations and hopes of the Chinese people. Examining the heroes of film helps us
understand who the Chinese believe should be heroes; examining the villains show us
who the Chinese are wary toward or distrust. We hope to shed light on some aspects of
Chinese society by examining the themes, plots, and characters that cut across films, and
how they evolve over time.
Second, China's government has a remarkable degree of control over the film industry.
All films released in China are first reviewed by the Chinese government, who have
: :
First, many of these themes reflect changes in modern Chinese society, particularly
exposure to western culture and society. Chinese citizens and government accept
superficial quality of life improvements, and seem to espouse it in film, but they never go
so far as to embrace democracy or actual western values. Westerners are still viewed as
untrustworthy and counter to Chinese interests: There appears, however, to be some
growing liberalization with respect to elements of social changes like homosexuality,
suicide, and depression, which are discussed in film.
Films might reflect Chinese social mood. There appears to be an underlying optimism
about China's place in the world - characters in Chinese films know that China is on the
rise and are eager for China to assume its rightful place after centuries of humiliation.
With this, they know that China will face many challenges and agree that a high degree of
authority and government control is necessary for these challenges to be overcome.
Chinese core values have not changed. Duty, loyalty, care for family, and the desire to
strengthen China are all core values that show up across all periods of film. The PLA is
shown as a universally loved institution, PLA soldiers can do no wrong and are always in
the right, supporting the Party and the people - which are shown to be the same. The
people's war concept shows up in certain films; as does the idea of resiliency - that China
is a resilient country that has endured for thousands of years and that will continue to
endure in the future, regardless of western actions. China's standing as a major player in
the world is viewed as an inevitability, and although outsider powers may take steps to try
to prevent it, nothing can stop China from' assuming its place of leadership.
Conclusion
Film is a powerful medium to explore society. As students of Chinese society, interested
in the ramifications of China's rise in the 215 century, we feel that there are many lessons
to be learned from a psycho-cultural examination of Chinese film.

1. A "Neo-Leitesian" approach to the analysis of Chinese movies
Nathan Leites did important work during the Cold War on the understanding of
Soviet behavior, and various studies have been made trying to apply some of his insights
to other (post-Cold War) opponents. Leites' studies of the operational code have spawned
a wide literature examining operational code of various world leaders (George, 1969; see,
for example, Schafer & Crichlow, 2000). [More - MA]
There are many possible lessons of Leites work for understanding China. One aspect
could be to develop an 'operational code' for the Chinese; another complementary
approach could be to outline what the parallels to Leites' books on "Soviet Style" in war
and management would look like. But also outside of Leites' work aimed at
understanding the Soviets can we find fruitful lessons, for his whole approach reflected
his particular unique awareness of historical, social, political, cultural, psychological and
other aspects of society and how it is reflected in, and influences, political and strategic
behaviors. Leites himself outlined part of this in his article, "Psycho-Cultural Hypotheses
about Political Acts" (Leites, 1948). One could even imagine learning valuable lessons
from a Leitesian understanding of Chinese art / artists, following how he analyzed
Michelangelo (Leites, 1986). The evolution of the themes in his work reflects at least in
part the strong curiosity he had; never feeling constrained to work within one or just a
few disciplinary perspectives, as the world rarely fitted. Schlesinger noted that he found
Leites to "immensely and widely curious .... something of a refreshing contrast to much
of American intellectual life, which was marked by a high and undue degree of
parochialism" (1988, p. 56). In a sense, he took an interdisciplinary spirit and carried it
further than most - even further than Herbert Simon ('further' here meaning stretching
interdisciplinarity, not in a career sense): "Too many academics tended to lose interest
when conversation strayed beyond rather stereotypical boundaries, and would excuse
themselves (at least to their own satisfaction) by unapologetically stating: 'this is not my
field' (Schlesinger, 1988, p. 56). There remains great potential to learn from his individual
works as well as his approach.
This present report aims to develop one 'application' of Leites ideas by applying
his analytical method in "Movies", or more specifically, the approach he (and Martha
Wolfenstein - his wife at the time) took in their book and associated articles. This aspect
also might lead to fruitful insights for our understanding of China.
The main work of their collaboration was a book-length study by Martha Wolfenstein and
Leites published in 1950. There are also a couple of associated articles that featured
aspects of their study. And Leites of course' remained interested in the influence of
psycho-cultural aspects of society, and therefore the use of psycho-cultural analysis to
understand the world, throughout his life.
An important insight from Leites (not just in "Movies" but also in other areas of
his work as well as implicit in his approach to the topics he was researching) is that
society expresses itself - or is reflected in - all aspects of life, including economic,
cultural, social, psychological, religious, artistic, and other aspects. At the level of
individual decision making, Leites studied Michelangelo's art and life and found themes
in his work that reflected not only his own history and experiences but also to an extent a
'collective unconsciousness' of the society and times in which he lived (Leites, 1986).
Movies can then be seen to also express social and cultural values, cultural and social
beliefs in a sense, as anthropologists, psychologists and psychiatrists have pointed out.
Leites approach was, as Schlesinger notes, an illustration of Leites' 'sophisticated form of
content analysis' (Schlesinger, 1988; p- 57)

Leites' work (and way of working) and early intellectual interests
Leites's collaboration with Wolfenstein and his work on movies came at a period of his
life where he had already made importanticontributions to content analysis under the
influence of in particular Harold Lasswell, and early mentor of Leites. [MA - short on HL
mentorship and their joint work].
He already was interested in psycho-analytic approaches - as a way of study and as
useful for personal development (as evidenced in his correspondence with Lasswell early
on). He also seems to have developed - perhaps more than Lasswell early on - an interest
in the psycho-cultural aspects and the cultural anthropology work of Margareth Mead and
Ruth Benedict.
[ma - write early NL / ML relations and their work before they met - including a bio note
(remember the piece that the archivis from NY PI wrote about Martha]
Also mention their awareness that movies a moving object of analysis:
"Twenty years ago it was easy to discern differences between the films
of the .. cultures we compared. .. Film making has since tended to
become an international mélange, and the question arises to what extent
films now express a more inclusive western, or world culture, to what
extent traditional styles retain their distinctive qualities. Whether in a
cross cultural frame of reference, or one of merging cultures developing
over time, the problem remains of analyzing the variations of the basic
human themes" (Wolfenstein & Leites, 1970, the preface to the
paperback edition of their book).
2. "Content analysis of Movies": Movies as Windows into Society And
Culture
"In the late forties ... Nathan and his wife devoted a year to seeing
countless movies, American, British, and French. After these rather
varied and extended encounters, they had written a splendid diagnosis of
the divergences among these principal national cultures. Each nation's
films reflected the presuppositions the values, and above all the hopes of
the society - and these varied sharply. From this survey, it was made
---- ---
quite clear how the movies simultaneously both revealed and reinforced
the underlying attitudes in the different nations. It was a good illustration
of Nathan's rather sophisticated form of content analysis. Earlier than
most, Nathan had come to understand what a powerful medium motion
pictures (and subsequently television) represented. .... He understood
even then that to a large extent the message was shaped by the
medium" (Schlesinger, 1988, p. 57).
In their joint work on movies, Leites and Wolfenstein take a psychological and psycho-
analytical approach, discussing movies as reflecting the emotions and beliefs in the
societies / audiences which they address, emerging out of the day-dreams of the writers
which themselves are emerging out of a collective social and cultural consciousness or
life; thus the note:
"Where a group of people share a common culture, they are likely to have
certain day-dreams in common. We talk for example of the American dream, of
which success in the sense of continually rising to better jobs and higher
income, and the acquisition of gleaming cars and ice-boxes are components.
The common day-dreams of a culture are in part the sources, in that the
products of its popular myths, stories, plays and films. Where these productions
gain the sympathetic response of a wide audience, it is likely that their
producers have tapped within themselves the reservoir of common day-
dreams" (Wolfenstein & Leites, 1950, 13).
Thus, the themes and plots of the films 'of a particular era or culture have particular
characteristics that one can analyze and use as window into societal and cultural values.
And although the relationship between movies and the societies or collective
unconsciousness they reflect is probably a lot more ambiguous and complex,
understanding movies might help us understand the cognitive and interpretive
frameworks that they represent, because the larger cultural and societal patterns reflect a
share awareness or experience in a society. In Leites' words, "The ready-made day-
dreams of movies are thus related although in quite complicated ways to the larger
pattern of the culture of which they form a part"? (Wolfenstein & Leites, 1950, p. 307). So
rather than seeing movies as representing directly an accurate reproduction of "manners
and customs" in society they "find in these ready-made day-dreams an interplay of real
life experience with the hopes, and, fears it awakens, the wishes it encourages or
rebukes" (p. 306).
The larger academic literature
Leites and Wolfenstein's approach to movies is one among other approaches to movies as
windows into society. Indeed, in the decades since Leites and Wolfenstein's work, the
study of movies as academic and scholarly topic has changed from ranking lower than
"such acceptable relaxants as detective mysteries" [!] (Jarvie, 1979, p. 374), to becoming
acceptable amongst scholars of various academic tribes, including sociologists,
historians, art-scholars, psychologists, psycho analysts, philosophers and even
economists. In addition, the study of film-making and its cinemagraphic details has
become a rather big area itself; some would say at the expense of more important study
areas. As one critic commented rather cynically:
"Film scholarship has become a flourishing surrogate for a liberal arts
education. The film department has in fact become to academe in the
1970s what the psychology department was in the 50s - a way to
legitimize trendy mediocrity with a bachelor's degree. Students ill
equipped for either the jobmarket or a rigorous bacculalaureate can put
themselves on hold for four years, preparing themselves for a lifetime in
the dark. The graduate burdened with only one idea, namely Jean-Luc
Godard's claptrap notion that film is 'truth at 24-frames a
second"" (Dunne, New York Times Book Review, April 1, p. 11-12).
Some of the more interesting contributions emphasize or combine a perspective on
movies as windows into society (what movies represent), and windows on the movies
themselves (how movies are studied). Jarvie quotes an Oxford historian, "the silent films
from 1895 to 1927 recreate for us the society for which created them" to illustrate movies
as windows into societies and their histories (p. 375). Semiotics perspectives have
focused on the role of symbols, rituals, and stories as guides to action and called for
'semiotic awareness' in the viewing of films (Eco, 1977, p. 14), within which one can
miss the difference between 'things making film's' and 'films making things'. Another
scholar uses mostly a sociology perspective to discuss the role of movies in the teaching
of sociology, as well as some limitations, (if viewed as illustrations of 'sociological
reality', movies can become 'pedagogical booby traps') (Demarath, 19xx).
The traditions that Leites and Wolfenstein drew from - psychology and psycho analysis -
are the ones which also in the subsequent literature on movies seem most prominent.
Which means, of course, that the study of movies has been vulnerable to the ebbs and
flows of trends and fads within those perspectives (which Leites was very well aware of,
and published major work criticizing some fads in the psychoanalytic movement, cf.
Leites, 1971).
Psychology/Psychoanalysts Perspectives on Movies
The interrelations between movies and psychology/psycho-analysis can take place at
several levels / dimensions, and there is therefore different literatures on can trace on this,
such as the psychological themes / analysis represented in movies; the depiction of
psycho-analysts in movies; how movies have influenced psychology - psycho analysis
and vice versa; and how larger societal trends have influenced both. At the most basic
level, one can see movies as representing the society's 'collective unconsciousness'; and
both movies and psycho analysis have as focus the unconscious ways and representations
of human motivations, emotions, and desires.
The two big themes, psychoanalysis and movies, brought together in Leites and
Wolfenstein, although different (one being an intellectual movement/discipline, the other
a visual media), did overlap at times during historical evolution (Creed, 1998). They
were both born roughly at the same time (end of the 19th century), and one of their
earliest interrelations was during the surrealist movements in the 1920s and 1930s where
some films tried to capture Freud's perspectives on dreams through visual techniques
such as the slow motion and dissolving images, or drew on Jung's ideas on the centrality
of the 'archetype' such as the shadow (Creed, 1998, p. 77-78). Psychoanalysts also served
as consultants to filmmakers since at least the 1920s, and even earlier, in 1916, a Harvard
psychologist wrote a psychological study of movies suggestion how films transform the
external world into internal words through mechanisms of the mind such as imagination,
attention, emotion, and repression (Munsterberg, 1916).
Psychoanalysts have also written about the depiction of psychoanalysts in movies [ !! -
perhaps Leites would notice the irony here .. narcissistic tendencies of analysts?]. To
some extent Leites and Wolfenstein anticipated this in an article examining the role of
psychiatrists in movies. Notice how they focus on the general character elements and on
the role of cultural differences (not on the fact that they are psychoanalysts per se):
"psychiatrists in films assume a variety of aspects. The various roles
revolve around the chosen way of dramatizing guilt. In American films,
guilt is dealt with by projection and denial. The good psychiatrist is the one
who collaborates in this solution, relieving the hero of mistaken self-
accusations and the suspicions of others evolved by misleading
circumstances, and helping to pin the blame on someone else. The bad
psychiatrist works in the opposite way, falsely incriminating the hero and
aggravating his suspicions about himself. The effort to establish an image
of a benevolent psychiatrist does not seem to have achieved a stable result.
The good psychiatrist (who tend to become effectual) is haunted by his
opposite, the malign and dangerous one, and more or less unwittingly plays
into his hands. In British films, which are concerned with the struggle to
control one's own destructive impulses, the psychiatrist appears in the
series of tragic heroes who are overwhelmed by such impulses, especially
in the direction of destroying women. The psychiatrist is a reproach-laden,
inadequate father-figure who fails to provide a model for the control of
destructiveness" (Leites & Wolfenstein, 1951, p. 26-27).
Almost five decades later, Gabbard noted how movies have indeed become part of the
collective unconsciousness: "Films have become a storehouse for the psychological
images of our time. They serve many of the same functions for the contemporary
audiences as tragedy used to serve for fifth-century Greeks ... Not only do they provide
catharsis, they also unite audiences with their culture through their mythological
dimensions in the same way the Aeschylus or Sophocles provided vision for the citizens
of Athens" (Gabbard, 1997, p. 429).
Another trend is that - perhaps due to the success (and therefore narrowing) of the
discipline(s) of psychology/psychoanalysis, much of the literature on psychoanalysis and
movies seems to look for the use of psychoanalysis within movies, in essence
approaching the world in the same imperialistic way economists have been accused of
(and critiqued for): seeing only the parts of the world that fits one disciplinary
background.
Some have mentioned how movies - and the larger institution of Hollywood - have
served as the cultural anthropologists of our time, with films "tapped into the commonly
held unconscious wishes and fears in the mass audience" (Gabbard, 1997, p. 430). Others
have speculated about directors' intentions, motivations, and identifications, trying to
understand, for instance, the male-female relations in many of Hitchcock's films
(Modelski, 1988). Or that the emergence of science fiction films such as "Alien" in the
late 1970s and 1980s captured a societal 'common development crisis' experienced by
moviegoers; in the case of "Alien", an object created to represent societies "extraordinary
paranoid anxiety" (Gabbard & Gabbard, 19xx). Others have examined the representation
of certain psycho-analytic concepts, such as repression and displacement, in movies and
how they come to life for movie viewers through cinematic techniques.
Analysts of Jungian orientation have pointed to movies as representing basic collective
unconsciousness, and further, how movies, by evoking emotions, 'instinctive, involuntary
reactions which upset the rational order or consciousness by their elementary
outbursts' (Jung, 1939, p. xx), can be source of power, fear, and reassuring feelings.
According to Jung, the unconscious is normally contained by the conscious, by
repression, or other mechanism, but when it flows into dreams, free associations, or
emotions we are not always in control. The whole setting of cinema invites the lowering
of the consciousness, as it provides darkness, warmth, strong images, and sounds. Movies
allow viewers to live the flow of unconsciousness, to fuse with the characters, identify
with the heroes (or the bad guys) - but the length of the movie limits or contains the
unconsciousness' freedom to play and the loss of control is therefore limited, and can
vary in intensity due to level of sound, intensity of images, etc, as well as technical
choices such as camera angles (Beebe, 1996). Some symbols stimulate further
unconscious processes in the viewers - extending the field of people's consciousness by
extending the known or understood beyond what's commonly accepted, changing
perceptions from one psychological sphere to the other - the 'transcendent function'.
Another topic in Leites/Wolfenstein was the analysis of particular characters in movies;
Gabbard (19xx) mentions this has fallen out of favor in recent decades and has been
replaced instead with emphasis on the function of characters in the film maker's overall
narrative - but it is precisely the characters and the relationships between them that Leites
saw as central. So one of the broader thematic changes from the time where Leites wrote
is the move from understanding the central characters and relationships between them (as
they represent societal trends), toward analysis of the function of the characters within
movies themselves. This may also have to do with the increasing success and
commercialization of the movie industry, helping to shift focus from movies as
representations of (and hence, windows into society), to more instrumentalist focus.
A few concepts used. As mentioned, within the broader perspectives, some have written
on the analysis and application of specific psychoanalytic concepts. A few examples:
Collective Unconsciousness
The idea of movies as representing societal collective unconsciousness is relevant to
understanding trends of national-cultural nature, focusing on "the activity of national
audiences and the conditions under which they make sense of and use the films they
watch" (Higson, 1989, 36). Key to unlocking and understanding this window into society
through movies becomes then to focus on the overall common style or worldviews of the
movies; the representations or 'projections" of national character they show, and how they
display the idea of national character in the films and in the viewers (Ibid).
Active Imagination
The concept of active imagination also comes from Jung and refers to a process that leads
patients to increase unconscious thoughts and decrease of the conscious control, allowing
images and symbols to develop from the unconscious content: "Active imagination is a
matter of allowing the natural mind time and freedom to express itself
spontaneously" (cited in Izor, 2000, p. 279),,Movies can then be seen to represent the
virtual representations of active imaginations of the film-makers; and can affect the
imaginations of the movie viewers as they engage with the symbols and stories in the
movie that opens the door for the role of the motivations and intentions of the film maker.
Leites (and Wolfenstein) also mention this aspect, in the context of discussing how such
intentions to change audiences can also backfire.
The newer literature also emphasize how the viewing of movies also reflects the
psychological processes of the audiences; thus discussing why, for instance, people are
attracted to the horror-science-fiction-type movies (Alien is a prime example), when they
know such movies do not reflect reality. Some find that it is because such movies bring
people in touch with their primal fears, and that the viewing of them reflects children's
experiences of their mothers as alternating between good and bad (the demarcation line
between the two represented with the transformation of a good person into a bad
'alien' (often looking identical to the good one as the body is used) - a mechanism that
probably also a applies to non-alien 'bad' characters. The representation of nurturing
figures turning bad sometimes evokes aggression (trying to destroy the monsters that
changed the good/nurturing character into a bad one), seen to represent left-over
childhood anxieties about own aggressive tendencies (Izod, 2000).
Symbol Play
As movie viewers may begin to internalize some of the anxieties projected from a movie,
they can also see it as symbol play, another Jungian idea: "To think of symbol play is to
set screen narrative in a highly productive context in the Jungian schema, for Jung
himself knew well the creative potential to play, He found it allowed him to discover a
way forward through periods of loss and direction and mental crisis" (Izod, 2000, p. 268).
Movie viewing can also become part of a larger 'play'; largely unconscious play with the
symbols, their creation and their understanding - sometimes using symbols as
mechanisms to defend against issues such as separation, anxiety and fear. The imaginary
world that movies provide can give rise to additional imaginations and imaginary worlds
in the minds of the viewers through the engagement of play and symbols.
Once again, this is an example where the literature captures some mechanisms that are
probably very sound and that Leites would have probably found valid - there are symbols
used in movies and people understand and construct meanings through symbols in
different ways.
Psychoanalytic scholars on films have also discussed personality concepts such as
'narcissism' [elaborate - mention' -wall street/the devils advocate as modern example of
a narcissistic character who may also represent a larger trend in society at that time -
80s-]
Summary of Section: From Neo-Meta-Post-Leitesian to Neo-Leitesian analysis ..
"When clarity is so hard to achieve, obscurity may come to appear
as an advantage one claims rather than a defect one strives to reduce.
'The term identification', Loewald announces, 'is used here in ... loose
fashion, so not to prejudge what might be implied in the concept' -
which is presumably as harmful as disclosing one's fallback positions is
foolish when negotiation. From the plain fact that many and obscure
meanings are currently being given to our worlds - 'when we ask for
precise definitions ... of incorporation, introjection, identification .... We
are not .... Likely to come up with .. precise agreements' - Berenzin
seem to conclude to the propriety of this situation: 'we have to leave
these useful construction's in some kind of hazy balance of
understanding' - a contention that might sound less plausible were it
made starkly: we ought to leave these words hazy" (Leites, 1971).
Leites was not a person whose writings area easy to understand; yet, in the context of the
modern literature on psychoanalysis and movies, his critique of psychoanalytic literature
makes a lot of sense: if one avoid fluffy words, and excessive use of difficult concepts,
one can get to understand some very basic and sound mechanisms about human behavior.
But sometimes the words scholars use adds confusion.
Reading the psychoanalytic literature on movies with Leites' critique of psychoanalysis in
general in mind makes it possible (or at least easier it seems) to focus on what he
probably would have: the basic sound insights that are in that approach, and what they
tell us about basic human behavior and relationships. That is, keeping in mind and
avoiding some of the traps within the literature itself; most of that has to do with keeping
a sound empirical focus and avoid getting lost in the field's centripetal tendencies - as
illustrated for instance with these quotes:
.
Not losing one's empirical focus when words become explained with other words
instead of with reference to reality "Renaming more or less plainly described
event by a 'concept' may give the impression of having explained it' (Leites,
1971, p. 132).
·
Avoid defining a concept with another concept, making a word salad instead of
....
insight: "In the rare case when a definition is given, it may consist in replacing a
word by a nobler synonym" (p. 200).
·
As the field has progressed it has become increasingly inward looking, assuming
progress is made: "Increasingly so, as time passes: 'progress' in psychoanalytic
theory had led to 'a better integration, and even clearer connection' of its parts: a
point repeatedly asserted, but not proved, not even illustrated" (p. 165).
Interestingly, this is not limited to the field (psychoanalysis) that was the focus of
Leites critique; it is probably a more general characteristic of fields that as they
grow and become 'successful' (in terms of ideas taking hold), they become
increasingly narrow, inbred, leading to (at best) short term success of the subfields
that result, but at the expense of the health of the long term development of the
field, and at the expense of empirical insight. Thus the field of psychoanalysis has
developed different subspecialties, talking within themselves, such as a feminist
wave, structuralist wave, post modern, etc.
With Leites critique in mind, the basic insights from psychoanalysis, such as viewing
films as the society's collective unconsciousness; representing emotions and
psychological dynamics through characters and interactions remains.
2. The Leites Approach
"Many of the situations with which we deal, situations
provided by thousands of years of human history, can never be
replicated in laboratory settings. But with properly collected,
annotated, and preserved visual and sound materials, we can
replicate over and over again and can painstakingly analyze the
same materials. As finer instruments have taught us more about
the cosmos, so finer recording of these precious materials can
illuminate our growing ' knowledge and appreciation of
mankind" (Mead, 1975, p.110)0;1:
[MA to develop short section on their collaboration and MW's summary of method in
movies analysis in the mead book]
The original Leites and Wolfenstein book on movies focused in particular on
relationships and has four parts: the first dealing with movie patterns / themes of lovers
and loved ones; the second with parent and child relationships; the third with killers and
victims (violence and crime); and the fourth with relationships between performers and
those who observe them. Their sources include over 200 films (American, British and
French) released in the year September 1945 - September 1946. They looked for
regularities and varieties in the recurrent themes, plots and characters (for example, a
hero that appears to be criminal but is not); the psychological interpretations of the
emotional and psychological significance of those themes (for example, the extent to
which movie plots that see the hero's hostility as result of society is reflection of his
projecting his own hostility towards a threatening father figure); and they relate the move
themes to the cultural patterns in American, life (for example, an American expectation
that sons will achieve more than their fathers and thus not look to him as a model).
Throughout their study they compare American films with British and French examples.
For example, British movies have more focus on violence originating from inner forces,
whereas American movies focus on heroes being threatened by external forces, and the
French emphasize the irony of human justice. They avoid judgments in presenting the
comparisons and have a chapter summarizing the key plot configurations that
distinguishes each category of movies. Using such a psycho-cultural method (or psycho-
analytic-cultural analysis is probably a better term) their findings are full of insights and
understandings about the characteristics of the movies and the societies and cultures they
represent. Perhaps not surprisingly (given that human nature has evolved over centuries
and don't change fast), many of their insights are still very relevant; and as a lens for
viewing movies, remains very interesting.
Main Relationships, and character dynamics
Lovers and loved ones. Lovers and loved ones is the first major theme that Wolfenstein
and Leites discuss. They see the issue of love as having changed somewhat from earlier
(US) films, from no longer being characterized by vamps and seduction (as depicted from
19th century literature) and "sexual wickedness", to being more about "wholesome
love" (p. 19). But the "nice girl" image is made ambiguous by pairing it with crime, bad
men, or shady environments: "This is essential to her attractiveness", Wolfenstein and
Leites finds, "it relieves her of the dullness of the obviously good girl" (p. 20). Central to
this is that her shady characteristics that may at first attract the hero to her, are only just
appearances and that in the end she is the same good girl that she was underneath it all
("The potentiality which she reveals in the end was always there, only the hero was in
doubt about it, and it is this which has made her interesting"). The authors find this to be
an "eat-your-cake-and-have-it-too" solution to the paradox of sacred and profane love,
resulting in what they call the "good-bad-girl" character that they find in American films.
Women may appear bad at times, but they are generally not, and often the movies are
about uncovering the proof that she is really: a good person, and break down the false
appearances.
Aightsean
Likewise, they find that the 'seducer' who formerly preyed on women is not out as a male
movie characteristic, because the current women are now too knowledgeable to be easily
seduced. But out is also the male protector, and Wolfenstein and Leites find that in
current (as of 1950) movies, love issues are mainly framed as female functions and
characters, with the good-bad-girl character showing both sides:
"[T]wo current love requirements, which in part conflict with one another, find
satisfaction in various film heroines. There is on the one hand the impact of
what we call goodness morality, which leads to high estimation of the charms
of wickedness as well as to guilt about pursuing them. The good-bad girl
represents a solution to the problem which goodness morality poses to the
:
man. On the one hand, expressing a more recent trend, there are the demands
of what we call fun morality: you've got to have fun (whether you like it or
not). If you are not having fun, you must ask yourself what is wrong with you.
The strength of impulse, which seemed so assured when faced with the
barriers of goodness morality, often dwindles before the imperative of fun
morality. A relatively new type of heroine has appeared to help the man over
this difficulty. She boldly takes the initiative in love relations and assures the
man of her confidence in his masculinity even when he is not proving it. She
estimates appraisingly the quality of pleasure produced by a kiss, but does not
seem to demand any all-out letting go of emotion, which might be difficult to
achieve. Thus she approaches sex with arman's point of view, helps the man
who is inhibited when confronted by an excess of femininity, and makes the
requisite achievement of fun seem not too much of a strain" (p. 21-22).
The development of the heroine in US films, to be almost more competent than men also
has destructive sides (they tend to be controlling and have tendencies to direct the lives of
their men) but the destructiveness does not always break through. But much more than
being just about female domination, Wolfenstein and Leites find it is also that the female
arranges things in order for her man to be successful (seeing his talent and helping him
get credit for his merits). Women must be careful though not to use her 'superior
competence' in too independent ways or she will be penalized (p. 22).
In contrast to this conception of women in US films, Wolfenstein and Leites note that
love relations in British and French films often display a different and contrasting picture;
in particular, the tension between good or bad girl tends to be more tragic (p. 22-24): the
bad woman retains her charm and the man suffers disappointment through her, idealizes
her but then discover, painfully, her badness. This essentially reverses the order in the US
films where the bad images are first and the real underlying heroine emerging only
gradually. Thus, Wolfenstein and Leites noter 14
-
"French films dramatize the breaking down of the ideal image of the
woman, American films, the justification of this image. British films in
contrast to both American and French tend to see women more as possible
victims of men's violence or betrayal" (p. 23).
British films also give more emphasis on the dual potential of men as both rescuers and
attackers, thereby giving more value to the unexciting but wholly good man than the US
films (they point to a recurrent theme in British films with a girl strangled in the park or
driven to suicide by her violent man). Essentially, in British films the male character has
much of the ambiguity that the female character possesses in US films.
Another theme is the endurance of 'true love,' if it is really true love. Wolfenstein and
Leites find that it remains 'as if it has been wrapped in cellophane and kept in the
freezer'. If feelings do change in movies, it was not real love to begin with. There is thus
little risk of suffering through true lovehin American films, whereas in British and
especially French film, this is not so, and lost opportunities between lovers can lead to
profound sadness.
Within the general topic of 'lovers and loved ones', Wolfenstein and Leites consider
several sub-themes and characters, including the different types of women pictured; the
transformation of feelings; the educational role of the female hero as taking initiatives in
love relations; and the general attitudes about loved expressed in movies.
Love occupies the attention of a great number of Chinese films. These are few deeply
romantic Chinese films (Love for Life, a love story about AIDs victims, and The Road
Home, a retrospective look at love in a, ruralfivillage, are notable exceptions). Chinese
films depict men as pursuers and women as the pursued, and they are all good girls (Go
LaLa Go!). The vamp does show up (Lust, Caution), but Chinese filmmakers have taken
a cautious approach in depicting romance;in film by idealizing it, by stylizing it as a set of
ritual encounters (Dear Enemy):' Love does end - breakups and separations are shown
throughout films, with dire emotional consequences (The Breakup Club); however,
despite challenges, if the couple felt true love, they would get back together and work out
their differences (If You Are the One 2). In this conception of love, there are few problems
that cannot be surmounted.
Sometimes, love can arise out of unusual circumstances. In Red Sorghum, the two
protagonists meet out of chance. A woman, betrothed to the owner of a sorghum wine
distillery, does not know what to do with herself once her husband dies. A peasant,
formerly part of her marriage procession, ingratiates himself with her - and the two fall in
love. Love in this example came out of opportunity. Love in romantic comedies tends to
come from unusual circumstances - happenstance meetings that develop into something
more, or friendships that turn into romantic relationships. One of the most popular films
in recent cinema history, If You Are the One, the lead male character becomes a
millionaire from swindling an investor and then posts an online dating ad to find a wife
and settle down. While he dates a wide variety of women, he ultimately ends up falling in
love with an airline stewardess reeling from a relationship disaster of her own.
With respect to the conception of women in Chinese film, it is in general closer to what
Wolfenstein and Leites suggest was portrayed in the United States. In If You are the One,
the filmmaker presents bad images - divorce,
Vorce: breakup, emotional trauma - and over the
course of the film (and its sequel), portrays the heroine as a complex but troubled figure,
who requires the help of a man for the underlying goodness in her to come out.
When the heroine takes on a lead role - an action role - she does not have time for love.
In The Red Detachment of Women, the heroines are a company of female guerilla fighters
on Hainan. The fighters operate in an all-female unit, although they take male direction
from superior officers. The lead female fighter is a diehard Communist, and when she
interacts with her superior officer, it is clear to the viewer that she admires him not just
for his values, but because there is a romantic element as well. However, she suppresses
those thoughts and focuses on the fight. In Liu San Jie, a film about a female folk singer
who battles rapacious landlords, the idea of love does not enter at all. When women have
a great deal of agency, they seem to move away from love and focus on themselves.
In somewhat contrast, modern US movies often portrays the heroine as being capable of
both a lead role and a female involved in romantic relationship (reflecting probably at
least in part the increasing role of women in the work place the last decades), although
there are of course complications such as career/romance trade-offs often being perceived
as being more prominent for women. An example of the latter is the a heroine in the
long-running TV show "NCIS" - the first female director of the agency - who had a brief
romance with one of the heroes before becoming director and is mentioned as having put
aside romance "because it didn't fit into her 5 year career plan". Some movies also have
female heroes that put their mission ahead of romance, or sometimes part of the plot is
that the death of a romantic friend entangles the female hero (more or less ancidentially)
even more in the mission. [mention other examples of the evolution of strong females -
seem to start in 80s and move articulated through the 90s- some, not all, are god/bad
girls; some are good/good MA]
The Good-Bad Girl
..
The dilemma of choosing between a good or a bad girl is a reflection of a major problem
in love-life in western culture, Wolfenstein and Leites find (p. 25), because the sexual
attractions a man feels towards a bad woman is hard to reconcile with the affection he
feels for good women ("a good girl is the sort that a man should marry, but she has the
disadvantage of not being sexually stimulating", p: 26). The paradox has several solutions
(sacrifice one side of the impulse over the other or combine them, sequentially - having
bad women before marrying a good one - or simultaneously through having wife and
mistress). And it is these efforts to solve this paradox and combine the types that produce
some characteristic feminine types, such as the American character who appears to be bad
(promiscuous or deceiving) but is really good. However, the bad images often prevail
until the end of the movies ("Till the End of Time" is one example). This character type
they find is a replacement for earlier images of female characters as 'vamps', a
transformation they illustrate with the change in spy movies from WW 1 to WW 2. An
early female spy seduced men from the other side and betrayed them, until she fell in
love with one and had to be killed by her employers. By contrast, WW 2 female spies
tended to be "clean-cut American girls doing a patriotic job" and are in love with men
from their own side (p. 34).
While the American style of integrating good girl with bad girl is to start with a good girl
and "spice her up" (p. 39), resulting in goodness concealed for a while behind a façade of
badness, French films tend to focus on the bad girl and when there is a conflict between
choosing a good or bad girl, the man chooses the bad (sometimes ennobling her, or
transforming her through love), sometimes through good first impressions, thereby
reversing the order of American films. Thus, whereas American films try and integrate the
goodness and badness, taking a good girl and spicing her up - French films do the
opposite. And British films seem to be less concerned overall with the goodness or
badness of the girls, focusing instead on the possible destructiveness in their men's
attitudes towards women. The women are mostly good but seduced by darker men with
destructive feelings who drive them to insanity or despair.
The good bad girl does not show overtly in most Chinese films. In most films, the
girls are purely good - they are chaste, caring, support their families, and support their
.. ..
partners (Eat Drink Man Woman). They focus on goodness in women and how women
can bring comfort to shattered lives (Ocean Heaven). They also show how women nobly
sacrifice themselves for the greater good (The Flowers of War). Where vamps exist, they
exist as an homage to old American, films (Shanghai); these films are set in 1930s
Shanghai, set in saloons and casinos, where the characters wear evening dress, drink
champagne, and converse in a manger similar to what a westerner would think from an
old American film like The Maltese Falcon. Or they show up in espionage films (The
Message). But by and large, goodness drives Chinese women and their goodness
brightens the lives of their men (Hot Summer Days) - this drives men's love, not
attractiveness or sexual stimulation, but inherent goodness.
Where the good bad girl does show up, it shows up in independent film. In Xiao
Wu, the title character - a pickpocket - enters a relationship with a karaoke girl who
seems bad, but whose badness is revealed to be a veneer over a good heart. She cares for
and is cared for by Xiao Wu, and Wu's drive to continue stealing is in large part due to
her. But independent films do not represent the mainstream of Chinese cinema, so the
extent to which this is applicable to broad analysis of film is unclear; generally, the good
bad girl is not a player in Chinese cinema.
Some of the earlier Chinese film from the "Golden Age" of cinema could be
characterized as good-bad girls, but due to the paucity of portrayals of love in general in
Chinese cinema, it is hard to relate this directly. Women are certainly portrayed,
generally, as good. In The Goddess, the filmmakers go through great pains to show the
goodness of the main character, who does traditionally bad things - prostitution - but all
to support her young son. Even in Springhin a Small Town, where a woman slowly falls
out of love with her husband, she is not portrayed as being good or bad, but a victim of
circumstances. Women, in love, have less agency - men push love forward, so it is
difficult to say that women act in a good or bad manner with intentionality. They act
based on the circumstances in which they find themselves, and men react and push based
on that.
What is not at all clear is which represents the "true" window into Chinese
society. There are a number of possibilities. One possibility is that the state-controlled
images of good-bad girls are the true reflection of society - this would imply that the
state's efforts at promoting certain types of political or moral messages have a direct
effect on the Chinese people. The Chinese people would then be conditioned such that the
good-bad girl would no longer exist overtly, and the state-controlled films would reflect
true reality. Another possibility is that the independent films reflect reality - the good-bad
girl is merely repressed by censorship, and the Chinese people do desire to portray the
character in films. Which perspective is "true"
truer is impossible to say - it depends on the
extent to which the analyst believes the; good-bad girl is an inherent psychological
character-type inherent in all societies, as well as in how much the analyst believes the
Chinese government is successful in it's moral and political conditioning through media.
[The good girl/bad girl still seem to exist in US movies [ma elaborate- e.g. Black Moon
Rising (1986), others]. There are also movies where women who appear as the good girl
is, in fact, the bad girl (in Acts of Contrition, the female character who plays victim most
of the movie is, in fact, the killer; but the good girl image prevails until late in the movie).
The Transformation of Feelings & Repeated Love
In European films it is taken for granted that love can come and go, and that one
can fall in love several times with different people, but in American films Leites and
Wolfenstein find there is less tendency to 'run out of love' for someone that is really the
right one to begin with: "If the once beloved person ceases to give pleasure there is apt to
be a complaining conviction that this could not have been the right one" (p. 47). Love is
then seen as a static quality that does not change through time. Wolfenstein and Leites
find the belief in static love probably a result of tradition of monogamy combined with
demand for constant pleasure (p; 48), in addition to the American denial of "the
evanescent aspect of life". At the same time, the characters of the loved ones lack
individual idiosyncrasy, although they deny replaceability of loved ones, indicating that
earlier relationships were not really with loved ones. If woman do love twice it is
sometimes because her first love was a mistaken one (p. 53). And widows often go
through struggle to allow themselves to love again a new man, which she can only do
when she has detached herself from her first love. True love never dies, but a beloved one
may die (they discuss several war-widow themed movies).
In British films, however, Wolfenstein and Leites see a possibility that true love
does indeed die sometimes. For example, a hero spy changing his identity and be reported
dead and his wife, initially sad, falls in love again with a man she doesn't confuse with
her husband or tries to make different from him. When her husband shows up she resents
his deception and looses her love for him. People can be genuinely in love with different
people, even when the loved one is not dead, but the wife simply falls in love with
someone else. Wolfenstein and Leites make an observation about the differences in how
movies portray middle-aged people: In the US there are "no middle aged people and, if
there were, they would have no emotional lives"; only young love exist and it lasts
forever (p. 58).
Love, in Chinese film, follows the (older) American model portrayed by Leites
and Wolfenstein. When one falls in love, one will stay in it. Despite some films that
portray affairs (Cell Phone), the implication is that the couple was never in love in the
first place - that is to say, marriage is not love, but a meaningful relationship that
underpins marriage is love. This, as well, i's similar to the (earlier) American mindset.
When recovering from a breakup, a woman might find the true love that she has been
waiting for all along (Love is Not Blind). And even after affairs, occasionally, couples can
get back together after finding they truly loved each other (The Law of Attraction). One
can, however, love more than once. Widowers, for example (Ocean Heaven) can find
love from sympathetic onlookers.
Love can more complex than simple heterosexual relationships. In Farewell My
Concubine, the two male leads have an arguably romantic relationship - or at least the
drama associated with it. One character fell in love with his opera partner and stayed in
love, while his partner was portrayed as philandering with women - as he was expected
to do. This is a unique case that was banned in China upon release.
Love is consistent. When a husband and wife are in love, it takes quite a bit to
break them apart. In The Horse' Thief, a portrayal of minority life in rural Tibet, even after
the titular character has been exiled from his village for horse theft, his wife goes with
him to an uncertain end. While love can be forced - for example, the arranged marriages
in Red Sorghum and Yellow Earth - when it takes hold, it stays.
In more recent movies, US films seem to have moved closer to what Leites and
Wolfenstein saw as characteristic of European films; people fall in and out of love,
relationships are dynamic, changing and resulting in complex extended families, (at
times) difficult tensions, but above all, blended families - reflecting probably the
increased tendency for men and women to divorce and remarry, in the US and abroad. It
is of course not always perfectly synchronized, leading to occasional heartbreak when
one lover moves on before the other; but it is often temporary and often a point later is
that both parties were better off with someone else. Even this very serial-but-ambiguous
characteristic of love has been the very focus of movies; the movie Hitch for instance is
about a dating consultant who makes orchestrating romance for others his business (until,
of course, something goes wrong and he himself. falls in love); Blended builds its whole
plot on the two main characters journey. to find each other (after being divorced / a
widower). Sometimes the processes of un-loving is depicted too which also can be seen
as an illustration of greater social accept of people loving more than once (and sometimes
loving more than one at the same time!).
Educational Quality
The superiority of women in movies'i's also seen to have an educational quality or
function, not so much in terms of the fact of social ascent alone (as one could perhaps
have expected at the time they wrote), since women advance in status due to their
abilities, but rather how women achieve improvements in position.
Wolfenstein and Leites find that women use their superiority harmlessly and
benevolently, and they help set the stage for men's rise in achievement: "She does not put
him into a passive receptive position, but arranges things so that he may realize his best
potentialities" (p. 61) and even have stimulating effects on their men. There is therefore a
tendency to deny any danger to men from female domination, by emphasizing her skills
rather than dominance, and with the men pleased by their achievements too. Manipulative
women appear mostly in comedies and mostly in an ironic way. Women also do not force
a demand for success on their men, but rather, guard and help them. Wolfenstein and
Leites link the theme of females helping or enabling male success to Margaret Mead's
observation that mothers in the US are concerned with the achievements of their children.
They are focused less on helping children, and more focused on what they can achieve;
they arrange situations that can help children experience success (p. 65): "The fact that
the situation has been arranged by the mother is not stressed; the emphasis is rather
placed on the fact that the child has accomplished something by his own efforts. This
emphasis is reflected in the American belief that one can succeed on one's merits if one
only gets the breaks, coupled with the belief that the favorable situation will somehow
resent itself" (p. 65). In other cultures children are expected to learn through failures or
protected from trying out their own strengths, and they do not have benevolent arranging
mothers.
Only rarely do men create opportunities for their women. When skilled women
are dependent on men, it is not because the men are superior, but because the women
need them for one reason or another. By seeing women with cultural demands and men
with biological needs, this aspect / theme. also reverses the earlier trend in movies with
female vamps distracting men sexually .: Wolfenstein and Leites also consider several
movies where the strong woman is a psychologist / psychiatrist helping men to recover
from mental confusion; him being dependent on her as patient but her on him because she
is in love with him (occasionally this can have destructive consequences, p. 72).
Sometimes women use physical force, and men their pawns with destructive
consequences ("Weekend at the Waldorf"),; marking a rare break of seeing female
dominance as harmless ("The Sailor takes a Wife"). Only very rarely is the man seriously
damaged by this ("The Macomber Affair") - which illustrates what Wolfenstein and
Leites see as a "pervasive trend" in American films: to deny dangers. There is no
suffering through love, suffering through sadness, jealousy or man made hostilities as
results of love and dominant women.
Wolfenstein and Leites also find a tendency for women to approach men in a
masculine way ("To Have and Have Not"), and for women to use a man's technique,
presenting men with images of themselves, and combining masculine and feminine
attractiveness. This type of woman also often takes initiative in sexual relations. But
women are seen to have to prove their masculine attitudes, while men are assumed to
possess them naturally (P. 77). They discuss how women make first contact through
offering males lifts in cars ("Blue Dahlia") or 'by taking initiatives at parties ("Till the
End of Time"), repeating otherwise masculine techniques. She also is less likely to be
overwhelmed by emotions and has a more detached attitude towards, for example, kissing
than was portrayed in earlier movies of the 1930s (p. 79-81). They note that the female
with a masculine approach makes the men feel accepted instantly, reflecting the image of
a woman compensating for (the authors quote Margaret Mead again) a mother's
"conditional love": "American children are often weighed and measured, and awarded
Mother's love to the extent that they compare favorably with others. The fantasy of the
immediate and unconditional award of love by the movie heroine seems related to the
suspense and uncertainly of this childhood experience" (p. 83). Such masculine-feminine
women do not always have the appearance of bad girls. A contrasting figure, of a woman
as being obsessed only with sex, they find in 'the bitch,' who never lets her men feel
good.
An early line for initiating conversation in US movies was to ask "Are you cold?"
A variation of this Wolfenstein and Leites find still present. They discuss the ways in
which first encounters happen between the hero and heroine through indirect devices for
achieving contact (incidental, etc), as well as more deliberate approaches, both of which
they find as related to the difficulties in US films of being impulsive; few couples or
lovers have much capacity for 'emotional exuberance' (p. 87). Accidental circumstances
may lead to intimacy but impulsiveness; is not a characteristic in most cases.
Occasionally, strangers even facilitate the intimacy. By contrast, they find that French
films present an opposite picture, with circumstances being manipulated consciously to
initiate intimate contacts. French films thus more readily embrace human impulses while
also at the same time acknowledging the potential disastrous feelings resulting from
unanticipated love, although both US and French films then seem to want to get rid of
impulsive feelings:
"Where French films may demonstrate the disastrous consequences of
being carried away by impulse, American films are more likely to show he
happy results of impulse within bounds. Thus both French and American
films seem to express distrust of impulse, but in different ways: the French
by facing the danger, the American. by denying it" (p. 89).
In discussing missed opportunities they note that these rarely are seen as permanent
losses in American films, whereas in French films such missed opportunities are more
likely to lead to regret (p. 92). British films too present lost opportunities as
'irretrievable' (p. 93) but with the difficulties arising from the intensity of impulse.
Female superiority in Chinese film is intellectual. They are level-headed,
determined, and have drive - in contrast to their boyfriends (A Place of One's Own). The
heroines are confident and capable, and while there are a multitude of examples of men
doing the same, it is evident that women (in modern depictions) have rising status and
capabilities commensurate with China's rise and opening (Sophie's Revenge). They can
even manage households or business (Red Sorghum; A Woman, A Gun, and a Noodle
Shop). Men seek to serve them (If You Are the One; A Place of One's Own). Yet, they are
loyal to their men (Serfs; The Horse Thief), most of the time (Springtime in a Small
Town). In Chinese films set in modern China, women are almost always shown as career-
focused and with a clear role in mind; they push their men forward, or drop them (Qin Jia
Guo Nian). They find men who are equally driven and passionate (A Beautiful Life, Great
Wall My Love). Women rarely overtly fail (The Postmodern Life of My Aunt), but when
they do it is because of a man.
Women are occasionally shown in traditionally masculine roles as well (Red Cliff). In
these roles, women become martial arts heroes (Bodyguards and Assassins). They fight
more elegantly than men, but fight alongside them in some cases rescue them. In cases
where they take violent roles, they play a traditional female character with elements of
violence, which is jarring and rare (The Sorcerer and the White Snake). They might also
become resistance fighters against the Japanese - in overt resistance or in espionage
(Shanghai).
Women are shown to have an active role in conflicts against China's enemies. They might
be victims (The Flowers of War), who suffer from foreign invaders, or they may be
resistance fighters (The Red Detachment of Women; The East is Red). The implication for
women - as well as for men - is if they do not seize agency for themselves, and to take
their future into their own hands, they will fall victim to outside forces that will not work
in their favor.

Love without emotions/feelings?
Wolfenstein and Leites end the section about love by discussing that, since in American
films, suffering is seen as pointless, movies do not tend to represent emotions deep
enough to lead to despair if lost: "There is a tendency for the feelings to become quickly
detached from a loved one who has proved disappointing by not loving in return, or by
dying, or by turning out to be a criminal ... There is thus little danger of being dragged
down by love for an unworthy person; love is awarded to the person who deserves it" (p.
94-95). Similarly, they avoid lovers suffering through uncertainty about each other or
temporary absence. Emotional vulnerability: is rarely shown - thus 'dangers' in US
movies tend to result from external violence rather than inner conflicts:
"The threat of falling hopelessly in love with someone bad or
exploitative or unloving, and so having one's life destroyed, seems
unreal. The shot in he dark, the beating in the lonely shack in the woods,
or the false crime accusation - these are the images of danger. In
American films, men and women may, and often do shoot each other.
They do not break each other's hearts" (p. 99).
This is not the case in Chinese film. While the end-state of love is eternal happiness, there
is great drama on the way there. Breakups, affairs, deep discussions about life directions,
separation due to circumstances, and other factors all stand in the way of love, and in
overcoming them characters feel despair. But after despair, the light of the end of the
tunnel becomes happiness (If You Are the One, If You Are the One 2). In Shanghai, a spy
film about late 1941 Shanghai, the primary male and female characters only find love
after enduring a Japanese invasion. In Red Sorghum, love comes out of suffering - out of
the suffering and uncertainty a widow feels after the death of her husband, and they find
happiness (until the Japanese invasion). The entire plotline of Farewell My Concubine
revolves around the suffering that arises from unrequited - in this case, homosexual -
love. The Wedding Banquet tells a story of pain arising from homosexual love from the
perspective of a westerner trying to break into a Taiwanese family. In Frozen, a suffering
artist's girlfriend much watch his: self destructive tendencies, while still trying to hold
onto their love. Drama, suffering; and sadness characterize the formation of love, which
makes its eventually attainment all the more meaningful.

Likewise, more recent western movies show emotional vulnerability, and lovers suffering
through (and from) uncertainty [examples] [MA: do half page on how this holds for US /
Western ones still (or not]
Parents and Children
The second theme of relationships and characters Leites and Wolfenstein consider
is that of family ties. In general they find that American movies tend to see heroes as
unbound by family ties and that more than half of the heroes have no relations. Among
the relations that are portrayed, the most frequent ones are between heroes and in-laws
and children, reflecting the US emphasis "on the family you make" and not the family
from which you come (p. 101). If children are 'present they almost always influence how
:
..
1
the plot unfolds - something they attribute in part to American emphasis on rivalry with
age-mates and older generations fading into the background. Female heroes more often
have ties to family through their fathers.'In contrast to these trends in American movies,
British and French films more often have family relations, with the French showing
women more bound by families than the British ones (p. 102).
The images that movies present of the variety of family relationships and the
quality of feelings and behaviors between family members also have differences. While
there is immortality in presenting sons, US films tend to present families in terms of
clearly delineated generations, and not a continuous series of stories through life (p. 103).
Thus they find a significant difference between US and French films in the role of the
older fathers, who tend to be central characters in French films, shown with an active
personality and particularly involved with raising children, whereas American movies
present fewer relationships between generations:
"Where parents or parent substitutes play a more active part, the children
tend to effect a quick and complete emotional detachment following a dramatic
break. The tragic tradition of Oedipus and Hamlet, where the son's life is
overshadowed by his father's death, is not perpetuated. In British films, on the
other hand, a son may blame himself for his father's death and devote his life
thereafter to self-imposed penance! In: American films there seems to be less
guilt as well as less positive feeling towards the antecedent generation" (p. 104).
Wolfenstein and Leites link the fact that children are not involved in long-term
relations with their parents to another basic trend in American films - the tendency of
characters not to be so strongly attached, emotionally, in love relations. Love can be
withdrawn and re-directed if needed, disengagement is relatively easy, and feelings are
relegated into the background. In American movies, the relegation of parents to the
background facilitates "the displacement to other persons of unresolved feelings towards
mother than father" (p. 106), attempting to reduce the image of father-son rivalries.
However, Wolfenstein and Leites find that it still shows up - especially in dramas where
the hero is involved in conflicts with an older boss.
American films also assume that children are innocent, and that they learn bad
impulses from their parent figures, possibly representing an interaction of the
immigration tradition with the culture left behind and the children successful in
emancipating themselves from that cultureranditheir parents. One way in which movies
portray the hero achieving emotional independence from family is by projecting emotions
onto others. The often violent impulses of sons towards fathers find a reverse expression
with a hero under attack by his boss; which makes the hero free from blame as he was
attacked by outside forces (in contrast to British films). Rivalry between siblings occurs
more often between sisters than between brothers, and also here, the hero is protected
from guilty feelings due to outside forces driving events. When, in dramas, there is
danger involved in fulfilling certain wishes, it is often accomplished through denial and
projection: "The impulses in one's own nature which may lead to danger and self-
defeating conflict are ascribed to other characters. Dangers from outside are thus
substituted for dangers from within" (p. 109).
1
Parents play a crucial role in Chinese film - in Chinese culture, the nuclear family unit is
the foundation for social and economic life, so to the extent to which films might
reinforce these values, parents are shown as pillars in the lives of their children. Large
numbers of films show children making sacrifices for the sake of filial piety (Great Wall
My Love, A Simple Life, The Road Home), which others show parents making sacrifices
for their children (Sunflower, Aftershock); Parents support children, they provide them
with houses (Qin Jia Guo Nian), money, advice, and their children disobey them at their
peril. In A Simple Life, the mother figure is introduced; when a man's maid (who has
raised him from childhood) falls ill, he takes ever effort to make her comfortable just as if
she were his mother.
In Chinese-language films produced outside of the mainland, there is some
resistance to this traditionalism, especially in the early 1990s. In The Wedding Banquet,
the main character has to reconcile his marriage to his gay lover (and impregnation of
their mutual friend) with his traditional Taiwanese parents. In Eat Drink Man Woman, a
Taiwanese film, three daughters actively resist their father's attempts to teach them - and
scorn him for his romantic choices.
For those who disobey their parents (or those parents who have no children), there
are dire consequences. The absence of the strong parent-child relationship leads to grief
and despair. In The Postmodern Life of My Aunt, an old woman with a distant daughter
suffers mayhem at the hands of scammers in Shanghai, being eventually forced to retire
to Anshan with her daughter. So although the relationship may not be strong, its existence
is a strong safety net for parents.
Manifest parent images
The portrayal of the older generation is usually friendly, but fathers have little
influence and are a 'non essential background figure.' This is sometimes contrasted with a
dominant mother, as in "Till the End of Time". As a result, there are more man-man
bonds than man-woman (wife). Other times the mother is critical of the hero. Fathers also
tend to appear not as competent as their sons.
The relationships between father's and daughters are also almost always positive.
Fathers become allies with her prospective husbands in order to try and disarm any
hostility towards her. Such possessiveness 'may be a result of 'mild retaliation' against
dominant women, as well as friendly sharing among men (p. 114). However, American
films avoid presenting intense father-daughter relations, so they are mostly superficial.
This is in contrast to French treatment of this theme, where father-daughter relations are
often emotionally intense.
Films with mother-son relations often show her as contributing to
tensions, although with little true influence - the potential destructiveness is rarely shown
in American films. And in general the images of mothers are in contrast to the positive
images of fathers (p. 119). Female heroes have mothers less often than fathers. When the
mother is portrayed, she creates tension, although in general, mothers appear to be less
foolish in relation to daughters than to sons. Only adoptive mothers tend to play more
active roles in the heroine's life.
Wolfenstein and Leites refer to Margaret Mead's assertion that American parents
(at the time Mead conducted her analysis) tend to bring up their children different than
how they were brought up, partly due to their immigrant backgrounds and partly due to
expecting children to do better than their parents (p. 124). Thus, heroes in movies have
different relations with their own children than they do with their parents. Whereas the
heroes' fathers are usually ineffective, the hero, tends to influence his own son more and
also have more dramatic relations with him than he had with his father. The heroes' sons
represent their immortality, but the continuity of generations extend only forwards, so the
heroes themselves do not represent the continued line of their fathers. He also seems to
have better relations with his daughter and inspires her. In French films the heroes often
suffers from love towards a woman who is a daughter figure (rather than a mother figure).
And in British films, father figures may have intense love for daughters in ways different
from both French and American ways, since he tends to be more cruel and terrifying (P.
128).
When female heroes become mothers in American movies they tend to find it
difficult and frustrating, so they are absent - especially towards sons. She is often more
maternal towards a father figure than towards her own son. This is in contrast to the hero-
father's good relations with their daughters. Heroines are also unhappy in relation to their
daughters, possibly because American mothers make their children feel they have to
fulfill her ambitions in order to be loved (P. 138). Sometimes this turns the daughters
against them.
They also appeal to Margaret Mead's insights when discussing siblings, especially
twins, as she pointed to the tendency to compare between age-mates, thereby giving rise
to rivalry and solidarity through eliminating causes for rivalry. Sister relations tend to be
more hostile than brother relations and sisters often love the same man and compete for
positions.
Heroes and heroines have parents at equal rates in Chinese film. Everyone has a
parent, and everyone's parents are to some extent involved in their lives. When they are
not, the characters become aimless (Lost in Beijing). In Jump Ashin!, the hero's parents
play an integral role in his development and recovery. The teacher/student relationship
sometimes substitutes for the fatherly relationship (Crazy Racer). The exceptions to these
rule come in historical films set during the imperial era, where princes often conspire
against their emperor fathers (Legend of the Golden Scorpion). Parents are willing to go
through great sacrifices for their children, for'example in Aftershock, which follows a
family trying to stay together after a major earthquake. Ocean Heaven portrays a
terminally-ill father trying his best to provide for his mentally retarded son after his
death. Children are similarly willing to sacrifice for their parents; a daughter undertakes a
journey on behalf of her father in Great Wall My Love, while a son grieves for and honors
his dead father in The Road Home by becoming a teacher in their hometown. Qin Jia Guo
Nian describes how complicated family relationships can become when multiple sets of
parents spend time together.
Siblings are very rarely portrayed in Chinese film. In the one film where sibling
relationships play a crucial role (Echoes of the Rainbow), the relationship between
brothers is shown to be incredibly important and positive - but for the majority of films,
siblings are absent. Another brother sister relationship in Summer Love is also very
positive. In both of these cases, one sibling is an adult, while the other is a child. In
Aftershock, the brother/sister bond among twins is separated by the Taishang earthquake;
but the inherent relationship is so strong that after the twins are reunited 20+ years later,
they instantly recognize the bond.

Concealed triangle
Because American films focus more on families that one makes, rather than
families from which one comes, there is less emotional significance in family relations.
However, Wolfenstein and Leites note that there are likely lasting impressions from
children's relations with their parents that remain, even if although unconsciously. The
emotions that are expressed instead towards others, such a boss, a gang-leader, or an
older caretaker who are often directly hostile and criminal. The hero is attracted to bad or
dangerous father figures and attacked by them. But whereas American films are
concerned with who is to blame for the violence, French films tend to express more that it
is not so much about assigning blame but about the internal feelings leading to conflict (p.
160).
American images of fathers picture him as violent. French images of fathers are
amorous. British movies sometimes have ideal or clean father figures with no sex or
aggression (p. 163).
Chinese films focus on families that one makes in the context of the one that one
comes from (Qin Jia Guo Nian), so there is significant emotional significance from from
matters. With respect to the triangles, there are few except in the cases where there are
coaches involved with children (and parents are still alive) (Crazy Racer). In one film,
Together, a child actually ends up rejecting. his coach and doing his best to win back his
father after the triangle led to a falling out.
Killers and Victims
The third theme Wolfenstein and Leites discuss is that of killers and victims, as
partial presentations of the destructive potential in all humans. Even killers act on only a
fraction of the destructiveness of which they are capable. One function of movies is to
present what such impulses might look like if more fully expressed (p. 195). They find
different distinctive lines in the movies: in American movies violence is not a threat of
ones impulses, but arises from outside dangers. The hero might have motive but is
usually not the murderer. He must rid himself from the false accusations and his own
guilt ("Human beings have a tenacious susceptibility to feel guilt for mere wishes"). The
hero is thus in danger not just from false accusations, but also from his own 'projected
destructive impulses embodied in external agencies ever ready to attack him' (P. 177).
Investigating authorities are often incompetent, leaving it to the hero to clear himself and
prove that he is ultimately a good person: "The hero, like the good-bad girl, has not done
anything; what is accomplished in the course of the plot is to replace a deceptive
appearance by an exonerating reality" (p. 178). Modern versions of this theme are found
in movies such as "The Fugitive," "US Marshals", and "Rules of Engagement."
While American films may be violent; fast-paced, or technologically advanced,
there are fewer emotions involved and usually little attachment or intimacy to the one
who gets killed. Murder happens when someone is in the way of the pursuit of a certain
goal. Victims are reduced to 'things,' and death, seems almost unreal in American films -
murder is a starting point or ending point Victims do not haunt murderers - only the
police. Thus, they conclude, in American films "the dead end either to be forgotten or not
to seem very dead. For the most part death remains inapplicable to the hero" (p. 178).
In contrast to American movies, British films focus on the internal destructive
impulses that one can lose control over. Murderers more often know their victims,
through love or other intimate relations, and the hero is seen to be overtaken by his own
violent impulses. Sometimes the murderer announces his next murder to the police and is
drawn into double identification. Violence is also more central; American films are based
on fantasy, but British films put the violence itself in the center as an act of destroying or
being destroyed (p. 179). There are also more feelings of guilt involved and the
authorities usually accomplish justice - Scotland Yard man.
French films are not so focused on internal dangers (like British films) or external
dangers (like American films) of the violent impulses in man. Instead, violence occurs
more when the central theme is 'irony of human justice' (p. 179). Justice is not always
served and both murderers and victims are seen as mixes of good and bad impulses. As a
result, death in French films appears very real and the hero too is mortal.
A central character in American films is thus the falsely accused hero - often a
stranger in town when a murder happens and forced to leave and to clear his own name.
Heroes feel like strangers pursued by the world for crimes they did not commit. They are
often weary and unsmiling (Humphrey Bogart) (p. 182). "They are hunted men, moving
among strangers" (p. 182). He suffers until he is cleared, and in that process more crimes
are committed, and/or the hero himself gets into conflict with the law, making it more
difficult for him to clear his name. The flight from police is itself a crime. "Aloneness" is
a central theme for this character:
"Perhaps the thing from which the hero suffers most, and which
contributes most to the semblance of his guilt, is that he is alone. As
Margaret Mead and Geoffrey Gorer have pointed out, Americans tend to
feel uneasy alone; they feel they are unloved and therefore unworthy of
love - there most be something wrong with them. They need the constant
reassurance of the positive response, of others to feel that they are
lovable" (p. 184).
Perhaps a modern example of the weary and unsmiling hero is represented in
characters such as The Fugitive (Harrison Ford being the falsely accused; Tommy Lee
Jones the US Marshall pursuing him - both unsmiling heroes in the movie); and US
Marshalls (Tommy Lee Jones again pursuing a falsely accused stranger) - in both cases
the falsely accused is working to clear his own name for crimes he did not commit:
hunted among stranger with no one to trust. The violence in such films is often more
personal than mass-casualty movies: and the theme of aloneness more articulated. Here.
the destructiveness comes not just from the violence itself. but from the lack of trust and
the uneasiness of no-one believing their innocence. Rules of Engagement takes the theme
of aloneness even further; not only is the falsely accused hero (almost) alone: his legal
defender is a recovering alcoholic, struggling to stay sober, and to live up to his retired
fathers unfulfilled ambitions for him.
Rather than partial representations of destructive potential in humans, Chinese films
portray violence as the natural state for humans. Violence needs to be repressed in
humans, or in the absence of authority; humans will prey on each other (Back to 1942,
Hero). And humans not only commit violence, but use violence to enrich themselves.
Most films set in the imperial period (Red Cliff, The Emperor's Shadow) demonstrate how
to corrupt emperors use violence to extract resources from their people.
At the same time, violence is used as a means of solving problems. In the same
types of films, in order to eliminate a corrupt emperor or leader, the people use violence
in rebellion - with varying results. Violence in struggling against foreign invaders is a
common theme as well (City of Life and Death). Violence used in protecting others from
harm is also morally sound (Bodyguards and Assassins). And in protecting the state (who
the character believes represent moral fortitude), violence is common (Lust, Caution).
Violence is justified when fighting against foreign invaders (The Flowers of War).
Violence may even be the only way - that is, violent struggle - to solve political
problems. Chinese films celebrate the overthrow of the old world through revolution, and
the institution of a new order (Liu San Jie). All members of society are expected to
participate in violence for such ends (The Red, Detachment of Women), for China is
always at risk of invasion and destruction if the Chinese people were to let their guards
down (The Burning of Ming Yuan Ming). Violence is sometimes used with comedic effect
(Let the Bullets Fly), although this i's rare.
The genre of wuxia films - those films set in the Chinese historical period that
glorify sword-fighting, heroes, and the promotion of stability - all portray violence. Films
like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; Hero; The Lost Bladesman; Red Cliff; White
Vengeance; The Sorcerer and the White Snake; House of Flying Daggers; and others all
portray heroes grappling against evil - with the only way to defeat evil to use force to
totally destroy it. Violence is used with purpose.
An important note is that violence never mixes with relationships - romantic films
contain nearly no violence - with the exception of Shanghai and similar spy films where
the element of danger adds to the thrill of love. But in relationships in the modern era,
love is just that - there are no crimes of passion - violence is used only to facilitate happy
ends.
Modern US TV shows (such as NCIS and NCIS-Los Angeles and Law and Order)
contains elements of both the "old school" Leites/Wolfenstein themes as well as some
commonality with Chinese wuxia films (violence used to defeat evil and facilitate happy
1
:
endings). The heroes are occasionally depicted as feeling guilty of having to use violence
(especially as rookies), but it is seen as 'what one has to do in the line of duty' (unlike in
Chinese films, the heroes often have to see a team-psychologist after (NCIS-LA) or
someone consulting for the team after crisis (NCIS) or take anger management classes
(Law and Order).
Performers and Onlookers
Wolfenstein and Leites' final theme is that of performers and onlookers. They
argue that American films "are preoccupied with showing events from a variety of
viewpoints" (p. 243). The theme is that of "looking and being looked at "(p. 245).
Looking seems to be preferred to performing; Leites cites the example of plots involving
professional performers - their careers are "fraught with danger" and they are often
"carried away by destructive impulses he cannot control" (p. 245). Conversely, "the hero,
as long as he confines himself to the role of investigator, triumphs; when he assumes the
role of performer he is likely to suffer for it" (p. 246).
American comedy films, make light of onlookers - comic onlookers habitually
catch other characters in "ambiguous but actually harmless" situations (p. 247). These
false appearances seem central to the drama of the film, and "resolution of the comedy of
false appearances corresponds in part to the conclusion of the melodrama in which the
hero is falsely suspected" (p. 249-250). Their prevalence, to Leites and Wolfenstein,
suggest that Americans naturally behave properly - there is no need for social sanctions
to enforce good behavior (p. 251). But this does not mean wishes to act badly do not exist
- the prevalence of false appearances in film also stand for "wishes that are not acted out
and which often remain unacknowledged" (p. 252). These differ from French films, for
example, where false appearances show discrepancies between facades and intentions; a
harmless façade might conceal a bad intention. Moreover, in French films the hero "first
sees things are he would wish them to be, later learns that they are different," while "in
American films, the hero first sees things as he fears they may be, in the end gets the
assurance that they are just as he would wish" (p. 262).
Other onlookers include promoters of, love - they "sanction or promote the
relation of the young couple or at least accept it with an amused tolerance" (p. 262). They
approximate fathers or might be buddies of the hero. Onlookers unite couples, provide
reassurance, arrange reunions, and are unenvious of the hero. Films frequently close with
shots on the onlooker rather than the couple (p. 266).
With respect to performer's, "we find that professional performers in American
films are very often shown as unhappy" (p. 268). Unhappiness comes both from negative
feelings about work and from failure to find happiness outside of work. They frequently
cannot find happiness in love. Comic heroes seem to be able to get around these issues by
themselves displaying "weakness and ineptitude" (p. 275), thereby becoming exempt
from penalties. Wolfenstein and Leites relate this to the practice of contemporaneous
American public speakers telling jokes 'and stories at their own expense - themselves
becoming comic heroes.
Men who exhibit women (as designers of clothing, discoverers, or agents) display
tension between the tandem issues of wishing to see other men attracted them, while
becoming attracted to them themselves (p. 278). In American films this leads to severe
conflicts. There plots to this effect - the so-called "magic contact," where a young girl
who has not yet begun her career fixates on an older male authority figure that might help
her (p. 284). And in an ultimate display of the performer idea, some films show
performers playing performers - actors playing themselves (p. 289).
This theme does not play a large role in Chinese film. There is one film about
Chinese performers (Platform), but it is oriented on showing how Chinese society
changed with the close of the Cultural Revolution and China's economic opening in the
1980s. Performance happens in karaoke. (A Beautiful Life, Xiao Wu); instead of
performance for others for pay, Chinese perform for themselves and their friends in
private rooms. Performers are explicitly portrayed in Frozen (a film about performance
art), and Farewell My Concubine (a film about Beijing opera) - but the focus is not on
performance for performance's sake, but on the relationships and plots that surround the
act of performance. Performance is only important for the types of stories that can be told
about performance.
Onlookers do play a role in some films. In Ocean Heaven, the main character
finds himself trying to find a home for his mentally-challenged son after discovering that
he himself suffers from a terminal illness. In doing so, an onlooker (a neighborhood
woman) falls in love with him, agrees to care for his son after his death, and forms a
relationship with him before he dies. Voyeurism is a plot element of several films - the
opening scene of In the Heat of the Sun is a young boy spying on a girl. In police films
dealing with wiretaps, the police themselves become onlookers or voyeurs in listening to
criminal conversations (Overheard). In Don't Go Breaking My Heart, voyeurism is used
as a means of seduction; a powerful businessman watches a woman across the street from
his office window, and by writing messages to put on the window, he seduces her.

3. Chinese Movies and Movie Industry
How can one apply Leites and Wolfenstein's approach to film analysis to Chinese
society? Both old and new movies may yield insight into how Chinese society has
evolved. We have indicated above a few examples of the application of the characters and
dynamics to Chinese movies - but have not said anything about the differences in
societies and organizational issues that may affect the differences in themes.
In particular, one would also have to take into account the involvement of the
Chinese government in the movie industry A a theme itself that deserves attention since it
may reflect how the Chinese government interacts (or sees itself interacting) with the
world and with the Chinese people. Here,one could start with Mao's approach to cultural
products:
"In the world today all culture, all literature and art belong to definite
classes and are geared to definite political lines. There is in fact no such thing
as art for art's sake, art that stands above classes, art that is detached from or
independent of politics. Proletarian literature and art are part of the whole
proletarian revolutionary course; they are, as Lenin said, cogs and wheels in the
whole revolutionary machine" (Mao, 1942, p. 86).
And his statement:
"An army without culture is a dull-witted army, and a dull-witted
army cannot defeat the enemy" (Mao( 1944, p. 235).
Mao thought of culture as a political tool. This tradition continues. Before release
to the public, a central government bureau reviews all films in modern China - at the
level the script and at the level of the final cut. This may reflect an approval that the
movies will illustrate some values and beliefs - and not others. Directors have spoken out
about the extent of Chinese government censorship in the development process.
Thinking about this process is important for understanding of Chinese
government, how it interacts with the society it ostensibly serves, and how it interacts
with the world. Other governments around the world use film as propaganda, including
famously, the Nazi regime of Germany in the 1930s-40s and the current regime in North
Korea. While China is not a despotic regime like those, it is still worth thinking about the
means by which an authoritarian government tries to keep control of its people.
The Chinese film industry is now the second largest in the world, with hundreds
or thousands of films produced annually. These range from big-budget thrillers, to
historical dramas, to independent films shot by a growing generation of digital-camera
wielding directors (as depicted in Stand by Me). Chinese cinema could be seen as a
window into the state of Chinese society, and those interested in keeping an eye on what
ordinary Chinese citizens are thinking about could learn much from watching the films
they care about. The themes, characters, plot, and relationships in these films could be
representative of broader trends in Chinese society. For many reasons, it could be
important to understand broad trends in a society like China's, so this project has both
intellectual significance and real-world "relevance."
This is particularly true because of the insights it could give as to the values of the
Chinese Communist Party. Research into the inner workings of the CCP has been
hampered by the lack of availability of reliable primary source data. All films released in
China have to be screened and approved by a Party organ, the State Administration of
Radio, Film, and Television, the main censorship body for such media in China. It also
administers or controls state-owned media production agencies. For the purposes of this
study, it will be assumed for now that the SARFT largely follows the direction of the
central Party authorities in making judgments about media and is not entirely an
independent actor. It could actually be possible that the SARFT could be a progressive
!
:
force in the Party, promoting media that may not entirely align with the interests of the
greater Party, but there is no evidence of this so far.
Chinese Film Genres
The United States has no formal censorship system for film. Rather, a film industry
group, the Motion Picture Association of America, administers a rating agency to which
most theaters showing films subscribe. A voluntary process, filmmakers submit films to
the rating agency, which recommends possible changes and then issues a final rating. A
film's commercial viability could be contingent on its rating; films that are rated explicit
(NC-17) rarely perform well in theaters. This process is devoid of government
interference; it is a voluntary process perpetuated by organizational processes and social
norms. Censorship is self-censorship done for commercial success; filmmakers promote
some themes because they sell better. To what extent does this factor in China?
Chinese film revenue
In China, all films released to the public must be appropriate for all audiences; there is no
age-rating system like there is in the United States. The State Administration of Radio,
Film, and Television reviews all films prior to commercial release and mandates changes
that must be made prior to release. Fu, writing in the late 1980s, wrote "all mass media,
publication, communication, education, ideology, and all forms of social and economic
organization are under the control of the party/state" (Fu, 1989, 268), although this has
probably relaxed in the intervening years. These changes ensure that films conform to
accepted Chinese Communist Party ideology and send the right message to the people.
Independent films could be released "underground," but their viewership would probably
not be as high as if they were released in theaters. Independent filmmakers could also
face sanctions if they are caught promoting offensive or illegal material.

Chinese film director Lou Ye has provided some insight into the workings of the
censorship process on social meeting. His film, Mystery, required significant edits from
SARFT due to a violent murder scene. In negotiations with SARFT, in which he
experienced delays and lack of response; he publically announced to SARFT the
following:
""I'm waiting for an answer: Can the film be released on time
without any changes, yes or no? The answer is so simple but so difficult-[the
process] makes me feel disappointed and sad, but I also feel a sense of
understanding and support. China's domestic film industry needs everyone to
work together. I totally accept the fact that I'm a director in the age of film
censorship. I just want a dialogue [with the authorities], and a dialogue is not
a confrontation. There are no winners and losers in a dialogue. There are no
enemies."{{1}[1]等待一个回答,能不能不做修改如期上映,行还是
不行?这个回答,如此简单,但又如此之难,从中我感到遗憾,失望,
从中我也感到理解支持和感动,中国电影需要大家一起努力,我完全接
受我是一个电影审查时代的导演;我只是希望对话,而对话不是对抗,
对话没有胜负,对话没有敌人[[[]”
The industry itself is comprised of a mix of state-owned and private studios, with the
number of private studios growing to compete for a growing market share. Large state-
owned studios include China Film Group and, Shanghai Animation Film Studio. There are
also thriving film industries in Hong Kong and in Taiwan, and these studios often engage
in joint ventures with mainland studios when releasing films. Tickets are moderately
priced and available to a large segment of the Chinese population, especially its rapidly-
growing middle class.
According to industry watchers, there are 13,500 movie screens in 3,700 theaters across
the country - one screen per 100,000 people. This is far less than the one per 8,000 figure
in the United States - China needs to construct 155,000 screens to reach that ratio - but
this number is rising fast. On a revenue basis, China's industry is growing six times faster
than the US film industry. Not only are Chinese films shown in cinemas, but US films as
well. US films actually enjoy the highest ticket sales, and SARFT allows 34 foreign films
to be released a year. These films account for 40% of China's box office revenue.

The evolution of the Chinese film industry in the context of the evolution
of Chinese film
The early history of the Chinese film industry reflects the societal upheaval China
underwent in the 20"" century, as well as China's transformation from a feudal empire, to
a Communist people's republic, to a modern state embracing some aspects of capitalism.
A brief history of the Chinese film industry can be divided through into several periods -
starting with the early activities immediately after the invention of film, moving through
the golden eras before the Pacific War, the resurgence of film in the Communist era, the
silencing of filmmakers during the Cultural Revolution, and the new generation of film
makers who emerged from the turbulence. Each represent periods in the society; but also
represent the themes in Chinese society over time - hopes, fears, dreams, visions, and the
interaction of ordinary Chinese people ....
There are three main sources useful for understanding patterns in early Chinese
films: Jeff Yang, Once Upon a Time in China (Yang, 2003); Yingjin Zhang and Zhiwei
Zhao (eds), Encyclopedia of Chinese Film (Zhang and Zhao, 1999); and Tao Ye and Yun
Zhu, Historical Dictionary of Chinese Cinema (Ye and Zhu, 2012).
Overall, there are five traditional periods of Chinese cinema (Ye and Zhu, 2012;
Zhang and Zhao, 1999). The first was from 1894-1934 - in this period, film culture was
introduced to China. The second (1934-1949) saw a consolidation of film production and
rapid growth in the number of films produced; this period contained two 'golden ages' of
cinema. The third (1949-1979) were the years of Communist control, with no foreign
films and propaganda driving themes and production. The fourth (1979-1989) saw
changes in film due to economic opening and reform, as well as the importation of
foreign film and the export of Chinese film to the west. The final phase (1989-Present) is
the post-Tiananmen period where Chinese film has matured and begun to explore as wide
a variety of themes as films in the west.
Scholars have also divided Chinese cinema history into generations based on filmmakers
(Ye and Zhu, 2012; Zhang and Zhao, 1999). The first generation (1905-1937) ended with
the start of the War with Japan and included early experimenters in film. The second
generation (1937-1949) of filmmakers was active between the war with the Japanese and
the civil wars, producing many pieces of "realistic socialism." The third generation
(1949-1978) includes the Communist era, through the end of the Cultural Revolution,
where themes were restricted to Communist propaganda. The fourth generation
(1978-1983) covers the start of the reform and opening period. The fifth generation
(1983-1989) led the way in changing Chinese film during reform, as the first class of
serious filmmakers to emerge from Chinese film academies. The sixth generation (1989-
present) represents the new wave of filmmakers coming out of the post-Deng period,
including many independent filmmakers.
The first film was screened in China in 1896, but the first film produced was in 1905 in a
Shanghai studio by Ren Fengtai - called Con
nquering Jun Mountain, the film was a
segment of a Beijing opera production (Yang, 2003). Indeed, Beijing opera influenced
Chinese film greatly - from supplying ready, stories to be filmed, to supplying actors and
actresses to act in them. Chinese audiences linked films to traditional performances like
shadowplays and opera and used those as context for assessing them. The party
denounced Beijing opera as feudal entertainment (for example, see Farwell My
Concubine), but this did not stop CCP officials from integrating operatic forms into their
own propaganda pieces - such as the dance and songs from the epic musical The East is
Red.

During the First World War, there was a dearth of film production, as Chinese domestic
industry, at the time, did not produce the necessary equipment for large-scale production
(Leyda, 1972). After World War I, it became easier for filmmakers to import physical film
reels for production from Europe, particularly from Germany. There was a blossoming of
studios, films, and themes - but as the KMT Nationalist government took power, by the
late 1920s there were fewer studios in operation, and what films were released were
subjected to heavy censorship. Legends and myths were phased out, along with martial
arts; there was a push to make film politically palatable and to be used to shape society -
in this vein, there was tension between films that supported the KMT government, and
films (leftist films) that were highly critical of the KMT - leftist films advocated for
radical social reform, and they portrayed poverty, class conflict, and moral decay. The
early Chinese communist party had a role in pushing forward leftist films, which focused
on social problems and criticism.
During the Pacific War, film production dropped significantly. What films that were
produced were propaganda; whether anti or pro Japanese. In unoccupied areas, films
produced showed themes of nationalism, resistance, and patriotism. Post-war, there was
competition between Communist and KMT-backed production studios. After the
Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, a large number of KMT-affiliated
filmmakers fled to Taiwan and Hong Kong, where they set up independent film studios
that turned into major industry hubs. Hong Kong grew to be a center for Asian cinema,
popularizing wuxia and other martial arts films inspired by traditional Chinese stories.
The Communists understood early on the propaganda value of film, establishing a bureau
within the party to oversee the messages they wished to be sent through the medium. By
1938, the CCP and KMT actually had a joint propaganda office, in 1938 headed by Kuo
Mojo. Zhou Enlai, a vice-minister of the National Military Council, served with the
Political Section in Chungking as part of the joint government - this section oversaw film
studios (Leyda, 1973). KMT and CCP film studios, with KMT filmmakers operating out
of Shanghai and CCP filmmakers operating out of Yenan, produced films occasionally in
tandem, but as the Japanese invasion waned, often in opposition to one another.
The CCP Film Bureau both produced films and approved scripts for production from the
private studios (Ye and Zhu, 2012; Leyda, 1973). During the civil war, the Communists
and leftist filmmakers used film in polemics against the KMT to rally the population to
their side. After the Communists took power in 1949, the film industry exploded, with
hundreds of films and millions of viewers. The CCP operated a Ministry of Culture and a
special Department of Propaganda that had direct authority over films. The propaganda
power came outside of government ministries from this special body.
Whale
In 1950, an eminent filmmaker noted:
"In the film industry, the basic principle is to eliminate the poisonous imperialist
films gradually and strengthen the educational nature of the people's film industry,
orientating our films towards the masses of workers, peasants and soldiers ...
Before the liberation, seventy-five percent of all the movie-goers in Shanghai
went to see American films, but the percentage was reduced to 28.3 by June 1950.
This is a great victory on the cinema front" (Leyda, 1973, 188).
The themes during this period primarily covered the lives of ordinary Chinese, These
included Party-directed depictions of "realistic socialism," and other themes important to
the Party. These themes were those advocated by the party for consumption by audiences
- not necessarily desired by audiences themselves. The CCP eliminated western cinema,
particularly at the advent of the Korean War; these were replaced by Soviet and Eastern
European films.
The CCP actually instituted a quota system for themes important to the Party. Xiao
(1999) reports that in 1951, the Film Bureau projected production of 18 films - of these,
4-5 were to deal with socialist construction, 3 with the war against the Japanese and
KMT, 2 with rural life, 2 with world peace, 1 with science, 1 with ethnic minorities, 1
with cultural matters, and 1 with children. While these were for state-produced films, the
Film Bureau's control over script approval meant that these themes reverberated in the
private studios as well. That is, this production mix was meant for state-owned studios as
a clear directive to be followed, but also meant for private studios as a signal meant to be
followed.
Communist rule was not always positive for the industry. The Cultural Revolution nearly
wiped out the Chinese film industry. Prior films were banned and very few new films
were produced; after the Gang of Four assumed control, there was some revival in film
production but only in propaganda films that buttressed their regime. Films were viewed
as counter-revolutionary, and like many aspects of the "old society," meant to be
jettisoned to build the "new society."
The final downfall of the Gang of Four ushered in a revival in film production, leading to
the rise of the so-called "Fourth" and "Fifth Generation" of Chinese filmmakers. Many of
these directors graduated in the same class from the Beijing Film Academy - the class of
1978. These directors embraced the opening of China and explored more realistic themes,
moving away from pure propaganda films to examine human themes common to the
experience of most Chinese. A small group of filmmakers produced "scar dramas" that
assisted in the repudiation of the Cultural Revolution - these films examined the CR's
negative impact on Chinese society. Other themes included examinations of how people's
lives changed from economic reform and opening - this led to a cultural reflection
movement from the "Fourth Generation" of filmmakers, who sought to reexamine
traditional culture. The late 1980s saw a rise of morally cynical and politically apathetic
films that ridiculed traditional values and showed the disarray of Chinese life.
Xiao (1999) also reports that since the 1990s, three major trends have emerged in Chinese
filmmaking - (1) commercial films; (2) mainstream/propaganda films; and (3) art films.
Commercial films have dominated private production, and the government has sponsored
propaganda films. Due to changes in the industry (studios suffering severe losses), the
new Sixth Generation directors began as independent filmmakers and have injected more
dynamism into the modern industry.
What explains film's success in Chinese society? One can see film's success as resulting
at least in part from the influence of the Communist Party in shaping mass entertainment
during the mid-20 century. First, the Party Viewed traditional dramatic forms - such as
Beijing opera - as "feudal" and instituted campaigns against them. They lost popularity
with the masses. At the same time, the Party established organs to promote film as one of
its primary propaganda tools. The Party's promotion of film and simultaneous denigration
of other forms of entertainment, coupled with the construction of theatres across China
(with low admission prices) made film one of the most important modern forms of
entertainment in China.
Scholarly perspectives on early Chinese film
Trying to distill the results from an entire literature is challenging - Chinese film has
attracted varied attention, with scholars approaching film from historical, sociological,
psychological, or aesthetic perspectives. Like the literature has evolved on movies in
general (see earlier), scholarship on Chinese' film includes not just analyses of films, but
criticism as well - in addition to perspectives coming from both inside and outside of
China. We present a brief overview of a few areas that have interested scholars in and out
of China.
Chris Berry has been a leading western scholar on Chinese film, producing books,
articles, and edited volumes. Berry argues (2004) that socialist film (1949-1976) was
pedagogical in nature, designed to push forward state control. Berry quotes Mao's
speeches from the Yan'an forum, where he argued there was little separation between art
and politics. For Berry, characters in socialist film had character traits that "are more
social than psychological, in accordance with the Marxist class-based worldview favored
by the Chinese Communist Party" (Berry, 2004, 35). Political loyalties separate
characters; "at no point is there any discussion of the characters' family backgrounds,
childhood experiences, or any other psychologically significant formative
experiences" (p. 37). He also suggests Chinese films contain characters designed to serve
as apprentices; they know nothing about revolutionary work, but learn over the course of
the film - serving as role models for the audience. He even argues the mise-en-scene,
framing, lighting, etc are presented to construct a pupil-teacher relationship with the
audience.
After Mao's death in 1976, Berry argues the power struggles, political change, and
opening in broader Chinese society was reflected in "post-socialist" film. One important
change was the decline of simple, heroic characters - rather than serving as just
revolutionary martyrs, the didactic paradigm waned - and characters became more
complex in both trait and function. For example - characters ceased being members of
the party apparatus or members of the revolutionary classes. There was also thematic
shift - such that love scenes (between individuals) became far more common. Rather than
films that tried to separate families and subordinate the needs of families and lovers to the
needs of the Party, the corresponding decline in the revolutionary hero and the rise of
romantic love signaled a shift in values. Importantly, Berry argues that these shifts
occurred before the rise of the Fifth Generation (155).
Chinese film scholars in the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution and economic opening
had similar interests in the new wave of film. There were a few separate areas of interest.
First, scholars became interested in films as serving not as education or propaganda in
class struggle, but as representations of culture. That is, there was a sense that China had
achieved success in eliminating exploiting classes; films therefore reflected not political
and class struggle, but when there was conflict, they reflected cultural struggles -
particularly struggle with China's ancient struggle (Chen, 1993, 52). Second, there was a
greater interest in "entertainment films," films designed purely to entertain the masses,
rather than send any kind of political or educational message. Third, there was an interest
in evolving Chinese film theory; rather than a focus on story and action, there was a
growing interest in the form of the film - how it was shot, the colors used, editing, and
camera movement. Scholars debated on ways to approach film - this represented an
evolution in Chinese film theory that led to the incorporation of western ideas, such as
relating the films to aspects of society and national culture (Semsel, et. al., 1993).
What is interesting from reading the Chinese sources is the relationship between film
theory and filmmaking in China. While in the west, filmmakers may operate
independently of the theory and analysis that follow their work, in China filmmakers can
be critics too - and trained at academies where the study of film theory is important,
Semsel and colleagues argue that Chinese filmmakers are to a greater extent informed by
theory - and the study of Chinese film theory (yingxi theory) could be informative for
understand how the filmmakers themselves think about the films they make.
Berry and Farquhar have considered gender role's'in Chinese film. With respect to
women, they argue that the role of motherhood - a role that "links women and the nation"
is "present in Chinese cinema, but not so prominent" (Berry and Farquhar, 2006, p. 109).
There seem to be few "Mother China" figures in Chinese film; Berry and Farquhar
suggest this may be because the "Chinese, term for the nation to which one owes
allegiance is already gendered male" (p. 110). Women in Chinese film exist in public
space, but they serve in patriotic roles - women are not mothers of the nation, but good
daughters. For me, their portrayal reflects normative codes - filiality, brotherhood, and
loyalty - stemming from premodern Confucian principles. These codes are reflected in
the roles and actions of male characters.
Methodologically, authors take a case study approach. They watch a wide array of films,
tie in ideas from related disciplines (philosophy, sociology, anthropology), and
demonstrate examples of their findings by pulling evidence from characters, plots, and
themes in film. They do not always tie their findings back into representations of Chinese
society.
Studies have a variety of themes, including looks into gender roles, change in film over
time, differences between the mainland/Hong Kong/Taiwanese industries, how film
reflects the political and economic change in China, postcolonialism, realism, Chinese
identity, and directorial styles, to name just a few.
Impressions from films
It would be tempting to stylize Chinese film"- to suggest that Chinese filmmakers portray
the same themes the same way across all time periods. But the Chinese film industry did
not grow to be the second largest in the world - and still growing at a rapid rate - by
rehashing tired themes and characters. The story of the early Chinese film industry is one
of continual evolution and rebirth. Affected like the rest of Chinese society by the
political turmoil of the 20th century, Chinese filmmakers reacted to the changes facing
their country (and pleased their censors) by portraying the plight of China and the
Chinese people in a way that would resonate with ordinary Chinese.
There are several thematic waves in Chinese film that correspond in part with the
generational system - the generations of filmmakers and of "film style" referenced in the
academic literature.
Chinese film came into its own in the 1930s. (Leyda, 1973). By the 30s, the export
restrictions on German silver film stock had lifted after the First World War (Leyda
reports that it was not until the 1960s that the Chinese film industry could rely on
domestic production of cameras and stock), a number of studios were producing
innovative films, and a cadre of actors and actresses (some coming from the Beijing
opera tradition) worked under the watchful eye of Nationalist censors. These were a
combination of silent films (with a music soundtrack/backing) and "talkies." These films
had a leftist slant - they intended to portray the state of Chinese society as they saw it -
in particular, themes like the oppression of foreign powers, the plight of China's poor, the
crimes perpetrated by the upper classes and their "running dogs," and the need to build a
new society (in this case, led by the Nationalists). A representative film in this area is The
Goddess (1934), a silent film starring the famous actress Ruan Lingyu. Ruan plays a
single mother who becomes a prostitute to afford to send her young son to school; when
his classmates find out his mother is a prostitute, their parents push to have him expelled
in moral outrage. Upon demonstrating to the principal her true love for her child, he
acquiesces - but is forced to resign by a group of concerned parents who do not accept
his ruling. Ruan (the unnamed Goddess) is arrested and sentenced to twelve years in
prison, and the principal agrees to adopt her son '- telling him at her request that she has
died. This film hits several of the major themes of this period - particularly the plight of
the poor and the oppression of the upper classes.
Another representative film is The Big Road (1935), also a silent film. This is a film
meant to inspire viewers to contribute toward China's national defense. This picture is set
during the Japanese incursion into Manchuria - although the Japanese are never
referenced in the film and only called "the enemy" - and the attempts by a work crew to
build a road to deliver the Nationalist army (again, not referred to by name) to fight them
off. This film is a celebration of male strength (focusing only on a crew of a half dozen
young men) and the nobility of peasant labor; the laobaixing in the film lament that they
are poor, but yet they realize the enormity of their task and make the sacrifices necessary
for China. They work on the road until their deaths, after being strafed by a Japanese
plane. But the filmmaker portrays their spirits as still working on the road even after
death, happily giving their labor to the Chine
se cause.
Indeed, the idea of a unified China" - of a Chinese spirit - is hinted at in many films.
There are snippets of dialogue referencing things that normal Chinese people would do,
or asking if a character is a real Chinese, or talking about the importance of staying loyal
to true Chinese over traitors or foreigners. This theme became extremely important after
the Pacific War and during the Chinese Civil War. It seemed as if filmmakers were trying
to reconcile the two sides in some way - by focusing on the danger of the outsiders
(western powers and Japan) - filmmakers could help heal the gap between the CCP and
KMT. They emphasize the importance of a single vision of a prototypical Chinese
peasant and push for this interpretation to be the "official" interpretation in film.
A good example of this comes from This Life of Mine (1950), in which a retired Beijing
policeman recounts his life - which conveniently takes place in the early 20th century
during some of the most turbulent periods in Chinese history. The policeman recounts the
corruption of the various governments (Qing and KMT), the Japanese invasion, the,
ensuing civil war, and the necessity for a unified. China. At one point he is asked by a
friend "Are you Chinese or not? Do you want to be ruled by foreigners?" A CCP cadre
remarks, "The Chinese people have lived meaningless for 5,000 years, dying unmourned
and wronged," showing the frustration the laobaixing have with the treatment of the
lower classes throughout China's history. The film was released after the Communist
takeover, so there is an overt CCP political message toward the end of the film - but the
theme of a unified China in many respects unites CCP and KMT interests.
In addition to a unified China, there is a strong theme of an old China and a new China.
The old China represented China's feudal past; servants, slavery, foreign domination, the
monarchy, corruption, and the old ways. The new China represents liberty, democracy,
equality, and a chance for the poor to make their way in society without oppression from
the upper classes. An interesting film representing this idea is Spring in a Small Town
(1948) - portraying what appears to be a bucolic country village recovering from the
Pacific War. Mr. Dai lives in a crumbling home with his young wife for which there is
little mutual passion in the relationship. An old friend visits one day, who has journeyed
to the coast of China and become a doctor This man is young, educated, and forward-
thinking. The filmmaker has set up a clear dialectic - pitting the old, decrepit squire
living in his crumbling home against the new China - the young doctor coming to save
the day. The bored and listless wife - of course - becomes enchanted, but does not agree
to take him as her husband until the squire has died.
After the Communist takeover, themes became more tightly focused around Party ideals.
Mao is well-known for his belief in art as a political medium. With the explosion in the
number of screens in China after the Communist takeover, it is no wonder the Chinese
film industry grew; films were an easy way to push a propaganda message across a
ravaged country of uneducated peasants - newspapers, for example, would have been
hampered by low literacy rates. These films were oriented around convincing the people
that the CCP was justified in ruling the country, and that while there were other parties
who sought to control China, only the CCP could have united the common people and
thrown out the oppressors. Many of these films are in fact retellings of various episodes
in China's history. The East is Red (1965) is a musical telling the story of the rise of the
CCP and how it came to control China - focusing on the various armed conflicts it fought
in the first half century. The Burning of Yuan Ming Yuan (1983) is about the burning of
the Emperor's summer palace by rampaging foreign forces. The depictions of foreign
:
brutality are particularly severe, and there are the same common depictions of the people
rising up as one to destroy them. The Red Detachment of Women (1961) is unique for its
portrayal of women as main characters - but of course, these women are in a special PLA
unit of all women fighting against the Nationalists on the island of Hainan. The themes of
sacrifice and martyrdom are common in these histories, as are the need to protect the
common people from rapacious capitalists and landlords. Liu San Jie (1963) is another
musical describing a folk story from Guanxi region. In it, a beautiful young girl struggles
against evil landlords with her talent in singing; all Chinese, regardless of their skills,
have a duty to struggle however they can. These films push forward a narrative that China
is perpetually in danger of attack - from inside or outside - and that the Party is the best
way to protect a vulnerable country.
There was little deviation from these themes up through the Cultural Revolution. Party
censors were content to approve films that fit their set narrative. Given the political,
economic, and social turbulence in China arising out many of Mao's decisions, it
probably served the Party's interests to have its narrative repeated again and again. The
Chinese film industry arguably had wide thematic exploration during the golden ages of
film - primarily in the 1930s. It might appear film themes reverted to what the
propaganda masters in Beijing wanted to push; that the censors restricted themes heavily.
However, note that many of the earlier films actually had similar underlying themes - the
whole movement of leftist cinema was designed to agitate for the resolution of major
social problems - including exploitation by capitalists, foreigners, and landlords. It is as
if the Communists came in, took the pre-existing themes, changed them slightly to fit the
CCP narrative, and held themselves up as the answer to the calls for help Chinese
filmmakers put out in the 1930s. So what might look like the restriction of artistic
expression could be viewed in a different way - the culmination of decades of artistic
calls for attention finally satisfied.
After the Cultural Revolution and the downfall of the Gang of Four, censorship
restrictions loosened dramatically. There was again a blossoming of thematic exploration
- to coincide with China's economic and social opening. After the repression (and
effective shutdown) of the film industry during the Cultural Revolution, the first class of
filmmakers to graduate from the Beijing Film Academy - the class of 1981 - led the so-
called Fifth Generation in the exploration of more varied themes, at times even criticizing
the Party and its actions.
Prior to the 1980s, Chinese filmmakers focused on narrative. The structure of a story, the
themes, and the way the story is told were extremely important. At times, the
cinematography, sets, and costumes faded into the background - The East is Red is the
clearest example of this; a musical borrowing forms from Beijing opera, it presents its
story is an extremely stylized way, stripping down all distractions from the audience to
focus on storytelling through dialogue and action.
Fifth Generation filmmakers started to tell stories through their cinematography, such as
choice of color, and scene structure. In some films, dialogue is kept to a minimum so as
not to distract from the visual storytelling. For example, Yellow Earth (1984) has quite
little dialogue - preferring to conduct its story-telling through sweeping views of the
3 .
Chinese countryside. The dialogue the film does contain could be ironic; a PLA officer
visits a rural community to collect folk songs to inspire PLA soldiers. The peasant family
he stays with laments the difficulty of their lives and how hard it is to survive in the
"yellow earth." The PLA soldiers responds, reassuringly, that all will be better when the
CCP takes over - but with the backdrop of the yellow earth and panoramic, sweeping
views of a desolate countryside, it is hard to see how that could be possible. Here, the
story telling is conducted through the use of muted colors and an ambient sound track.
In Red Sorghum, Zhang Yimou uses colors to express emotions - in a film about passion,
love, and emotion, Zhang constructs shots of vibrant red and green to convey the
expression of emotion. After the same theme's and filmmaking styles of the Communist
era in the middle part of the century, seeing filmmakers willing to explore in such a way
is refreshing. It is as if the colors represent not just the themes the filmmakers want to
portray, but also their own feelings of relief - they could start to experiment, and they did
so as much as they could.
As storytelling changed in the 1980s, so did the stories themselves. Some films covered
familiar ground, like the Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese Civil War, or other periods of
political turmoil in which the CCP won. Red Sorghum and Yellow Earth were both set in
the 1940s. A new genre emerged during this period, called the scar film. These films were
primarily concerned with the excesses of the Cultural Revolution.
One example of this genre, Farewell My Concubine, is regarded as one of the first films
to attract wide attention outside of China, Farewell My Concubine is an epic that spans a
half century of Chinese history, examining some of the most turbulent historical episodes
of the 20th century. The film follows two main characters - two opera singers trained
from childhood to practice Beijing Opera. The film is at once an historical epic portraying
the Japanese invasion, the Chinese civil war, the rise of the Communist Party, and the
chaos of the Cultural Revolution - but at the same time a melodrama exploring the
relationship between the two actors. The film was at first banned in China - its themes of
preserving individualism and idiosyncrasy in the face of historical forces and fate did not
sit well with Party censors, nor did its portrayal of the Red Guards' actions during the
Cultural Revolution. This is one of the core works of the Fifth Generation of filmmakers -
and was one of the first Chinese films to attract wide attention outside of China. The film
actually begins with a denunciation of the Cultural Revolution - and it shows scenes of
Red Guard brutality and struggle sessions that must have been vivid in the memory of
audiences at the time.
This raises an interesting question - Chinese films portray a wide variety of historical
events. They reference classical Chinese literature, historical figures, and what are
seemingly obscure events. To what extent de viewers need to be aware of Chinese history
to understand these films? This would suggest a high degree of political and historical
education among ordinary Chinese, as many of the events here are not explained well in
the narratives themselves; they are set-pieces around which the filmmakers tell stories.
What may appear to be a cliched set of events from an outsider's perspective (ex: the
Sino-Japanese War) may have deeper meaning for the typical Chinese viewer. An
unanswered question is exactly what kinds of deeper meanings Chinese viewers draw
from these set-piece type plots. What does a Chinese viewer expect from a film about
World War Two? Are films sometimes designed to confound their expectations? Do they
get primed with certain feelings from set-pieces? Do they expect to see certain types of
characters? Does viewing such films satisfy an emotional need that comes from another
part of their life? Films are embedded in a larger social fabric; to understand them, it is
necessary to understand the social forces and cultural context from which they come.
How much do Chinese films draw from Beijing opera? Some of the earliest actors in the
film industry came from the operatic tradition. Several films reference, explicitly, operatic
forms - for example, The East is Red and its por
portrayal of the rise of the CCP, Lui San Jie
and its use of folk singing to combat landlords, and Farewell My Concubine with its
entire plot revolving around an opera troupe. Yet, it is interesting to see any relationships
at all - given that in the 1950s, the CCP began denouncing Beijing opera as a feudalistic
ritual and began to suppress opera. This is, in fact, depicted in Farewell My Concubine.
What are the relationships between the various types of Chinese creative expression? Are
there still relationships between film and opera? Or other forms of stage acting? Or
singing?
Chinese film is remarkable because it is at once dynamic and static. There is wide variety
in the themes expressed - and how they are expressed - between the different periods.
However, there is a great deal of continuity in some of the underlying themes. Even
recent films still cover familiar themes like the Sino-Japanese War, exploitation by
foreigners, and the plight of the poor before the CCP takeover. This continuity is
remarkable given the change in China over the 2011 century. Does this continuity reflect
desires by filmmakers and censors to send similar messages? Does it reflect demand from
a movie-going public for certain stories? Is it unique to China? Or do we see the same
types of themes in American, British, and French films too - themes core not just to a
national experience, but to the human experience writ large.
4. Modern Films, Selection
Film is a medium through which artists express the underlying passions, fears, and
thoughts of the society in which they are created. Harris and Sklar (1998) view cinema as
"a complex, historically situated, economically, grounded social and collective activity
with its own unique forms of life." (Harris and Sklar, 1998, 225). China's film industry is
growing at a fast pace and is now the second largest in the world. A new generation of
independent filmmakers using digital technology and the Internet has allowed for this
growth. An additional wrinkle that makes the Chinese film industry unique is the extent
of government control on the industry. Chinese censors review every film before release
to ensure that it conforms to the standards of the government and the Chinese Communist
Party. This implies that every film released at best demonstrates themes the Party would
like shown to the broader population, and at worst demonstrates themes that are neutral to
the goals of the Party. It is possible that films could show not only what the people are
thinking, but the government as well.
The selection of films is important if the themes taken from them are meant to be
meaningful. The films that resonate most with the broadest segment of society are
probably those films that were viewed the most. Popular films must appeal to many
people for some reason, possibly because their underlying themes and message resonate
at a very basic level. Therefore the themes that come out of these films will be simple, but
might apply to an entire society. As a proxy to measure attendance, this study uses
revenue.
After looking at lists of the top ten grossing films in China for several of the years
between 2006-2012, films were selected both in and out of those categories for popular
appeal as well as for more independent films that could reflect emerging themes. Also
discussed with people familiar with Chinese film industry to develop a section as
authentic as possible.
The modern films in the main sample were released between 1994-2012 and range in
genre, with the most representation in historical dramas about the imperial era, historical
dramas about the first half of the 20
th
century, and romantic films set in the modern era.
The following is a description of themes, characters, plots, and relationships that come
out of this selection. A note about this selection before continuing: since many of these
films are historical dramas set during China's, warring states era, many of them focus on
palace intrigue, conflict between states, and the relationships between members of the
imperial court. It is interesting to think about why these films are the most popular in
China, but it should be noted that many of the themes and characters described here
follow from the general theme of historical China.
How might one think about film? It might be useful to approach the topic from the
viewpoint of content analysis. Leites and de Sola Pool (1942) identify five criteria for
work that is appropriate for analysis:
"(1) It must refer either to syntactic characteristics of symbols ... or to semantic
characteristics"
"(2) It must indicate frequencies of occurrence of such characteristics with a high degree
of precision"
"(3) It must refer to these characteristics by terms which are general ... or by terms which
are by definition subsumable under such general terms"
"(4) It must refer to these characteristics which occur ... in universal propositions of social
science"
"(5) A high precision of the terms used to refer to the symbol characteristics
studied" (Leites and de Sola Pool, 1942, 1-2).
Higson (1989) describes some salient questions that might be asked about film -
particularly the concept of "national cinema," which focuses on how films might reflect
the underlying feelings of an entire country. He suggests asking several questions: "what
are these films about? Do they share a common style or world view? What sort of
projections of the national character do they offer? To what extent are they engaged in
'exploring, questioning, and constructing a notion of nationhood in the films themselves
and in the consciousness of the viewer?" (Higson, 1989, 36).
Finally, Mead, in her seminal article on visual anthropology, sums up the concept of
studying film as a means of understanding society - although in this context she refers to
visual technology in general:
"Many of the situations with which we deal, situations provided by thousands of
years of human history, can never be replicated in laboratory settings. But with
properly collected, annotated, and preserved visual and sound materials, we can
replicate over and over again and can painstakingly analyze the same materials.
As finer instruments have taught us more about the cosmos, so finer recording of
these precious materials can illuminate our growing knowledge and appreciation
of mankind" (Mead, 1975, 10).
This study explores Chinese film as a means of attempting to understand Chinese society.
Following Mead, Higson, and especially Leites' approaches, we examine how Chinese
film might evoke some themes or aspects of Chinese society that are otherwise unclear.
Film, as well as other media, is well documented to be an important part of Chinese
society. Even in 1988, "the typical Chinese youngster in Beijing has access to a moderate
media environment in their own home. There were one or two audio cassette units in the
respondents' homes, while radio, black and white TV sets, and colour TV sets were in
eight or nine of every 10 homes" (Greenberg, et. al., 1991, 126). This is compared to a
telephone in only one of every ten homes - media technology exceeding communications
technology shows the importance of such means of expression in the Chinese mind.
Moreover, the Chinese Communist Party has a long history of using media: "The CPC
began to tap the potentials of film as a tool of propaganda when it set up the Yan'an Film
Group in 1938" (Han and Chen, 2000, 37).
Chinese film has changed since China's economic opening. Reform has not, according to
Liu and McCormick (2011), been a government-directed project, but has come from
simple marketization. They argue the."Chinese government has somewhat relaxed
standards on films, but "this is not to say that censorship and political control has become
ineffective or irrelevant. But these controls; are different in scope and effectiveness from
the monopoly wielded by the party in the pre-reform period. This is because, first of all,
the enormous volume of media content is making close supervision increasingly difficult
and allowing for more commentary on a greater range of topics. Second, under the new
conditions of media production, the authorities have had to trade off political standards
for economic concerns to be some extent" (Liu and McCormick, 2011, 122). The
government is less able to control what people say and watch.
This tension might reveal more about Chinese society than if it were controlled totally by
the government. Film becomes more evocative of the latent proclivities of the Chinese
citizenry, while retaining some aspects of the government control that makes it interesting
to consider from a government perspective: The themes, characters, and plots described
here are an attempt to derive some broader!meaning out of a complex and fragmented
data set.
In addition to relaxing standards, film studios are now seen as part of industry. "Film
studios are now being treated as enterprises, as other industries are, in terms of their
management. The early reform in separating the party from the administration took place
in film studios in the form of letting the director rather than the party secretary oversee
the production .... " (Han and Chen, 2000, 39). Rather than being "state-financed cultural
institutions," they become "industrial enterprises." Ticket sales now drive studio budgets
rather than government subsidies.
Social effects are still considered when planning films, but "as a former director of
Beijing Film Studio remarked, the film industry must first and foremost survive before it
can talk about development because "you cannot sing the leitmotif with an empty
stomach." (Han and Chen, 2000, 39). Commercial interests play a primary role in film
development, focusing on themes close to the lives of viewers.
We might, therefore, temper our assessment of the extent to which the Chinese
government has a role in directing film content. In the case of major propaganda films
(such as The Founding of a Republic), the government heavily subsidized and promoted
the films, but in the case of independent films like Ocean Heaven, it probably has a
smaller role to play.
How does this affect an analyst's interpretation of the themes, characters, plots, and
relationships depicted? Beebe has written on the Jungian illumination of film (Beebe,
1996), and in particular the concept of a collective unconscious. He quotes Jung as
writing "One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making
the darkness conscious" (Beebe, 1996, 579). Film might be a medium in which the
unconsciousness of a collective people could be portrayed - the hopes, fears, dreams that
they hold but do not say out loud might be evoked in film images, "as if it were a regular
part of reality" (Beebe, 1996, 579). The party still plays a role, as it created new forms of
film that cloak state ideology in social morals: "A second aspect of state-industry
collaboration was an effort to create a more attractive form of propaganda through a
peculiar hybrid of political authority and market forces: the updated major melody
film" (Wan and Kraus, 2002, 429).
As an interpretive framework, therefore, it could be illuminating to consider the concept
of a collective unconscious in tandem with aspects of state control. The state might,
through support of certain films.(concept of picking winning horses), signal its desire to
mold the interests of the Chinese people unconsciously. This approach also implies that
the films that perform the best or are talked about the most best represent some
underlying Chinese values.
5. Possible themes
Early films and relationships with Leites themes
In comparing the early Chinese films with the Leitesian categories, it is important to
make one caveat - the Leitesian categories were developed out of three film traditions
that did not have a history of government control, or perhaps even a desire to send
political messages through film. If one can make any generalizations about Chinese film
as a whole - they try to send a message, They are not stories about love or killers and
victims or families - they are stories about politics, society, or human nature that involve
families, love, and killers/victims. Leites an'd Wolfenstein, approaching films from a
psychocultural perspective, focused on psychological characteristics of film characters,
themes, and plots to understand the psychological background of the societies from
which these films came. It is not clear that films coming from a society that values state
control over media - and films with clear moral/political messages - could be analyzed in
the same way. We observe some similarities between some of the broad themes Leites
described, but the content of the themes differs.
Wolfenstein and Leites describe at length "lovers and loved ones." In particular, they
describe the good/bad girl, vamps, the phenomenon of loving twice, types of plots/scenes
where love can occur, and national variations. Early Chinese films, as prior authors and
we have described, do not emphasize love and lovers. Relationships and courting
certainly exist, but they serve as vehicles for describing socialist or communist lessons;
films do not explore relationships for the sake of exploring relationships. For example, in
Spring in a Small Town, the primary storyline is a love triangle and the film describes its
evolution. However, it is apparent that the characters are stand-in representations of
China itself; old China, new China, and the Chinese people. The psychological
experience of the characters is subordinated to the social commentary role they fill.
Wolfenstein and Leites write that in American films, heroes and heroines are unbound by
family ties. They suggest the American emphasis is on "the family you make, as against
the family you come from." There is some mixed evidence from Chinese films.
.
Characters in early Chinese films are shown to care about the families from which they
come - for example, in one case (National Customs), two sisters travel to Shanghai for
education, and while they argue and disagree, in the end stick together. But yet, there is a
clear emphasis on the family made as well - for example, in Street Angel, the plot of the
film is around a budding relationship by neighbors. Towards the Communist Era, we see
less emphasis on families; they become vehicles, like relationships in general, for
promoting socialist/communist ideals. In some cases, they are not that important at all -
for example, in The Red Detachment of Women, where the primary protagonist's family is
barely mentioned. Communist cadres are rarely ever shown with families - they are
depicted as independent and intrepid, free of the ties that hold back the Chinese people
and ready to work - wholeheartedly, without any distractions, for the advancement of the
Chinese people. The omission of family ties here is symbolic of their commitment to the
greater family from which all Chinese people come: the Chinese motherland. Given the
emphasis on Confucian values in many films, one could read the omission of family as a
signal that Chinese characters focus on an overarching sense of family (or they are meant
to) as country.
There seems, according to Wolfenstein and Leites, to be an inordinate amount of killings
and murders in American, British, and French movies. There are few explorations of
violence in Chinese film in the early era; they would have never passed censors. When
violence does occur, it is to demonstrate some, social message (landlords shown abusing
peasants), to demonstrate the historical abuse of the Chinese people (foreign troops
massacring Chinese civilians), or the destruction of China's enemies (Nationalist troops
being slaughtered by PLA soldiers). There are no overt crime or mystery films like there
are in the western tradition. Violence, death, and murder all occur within the context of
the political and social stories the filmmakers seek to tell; they are, in the Leitesian sense,
"killing with a purpose." But the purpose is not to conceal a crime, or the discovery of
mysteries, or frustration in love - the purpose is the promotion of some political or
cultural or moral objective.
The perspectives shown in these films do not, like in American films, show events from
many viewpoints. While to some extent characters will spy on one another - or plot
against one another - there are few depictions of characters looking or being looked at,
except in the case of films that deal with professional performers (Farewell My
Concubine). This major theme described in the Movies book has little relevance here.
In all, the Leitesian themes described in the Wolfenstein and Leites book have general,
but limited application to early Chinese films. Early Chinese filmmakers drew inspiration
from traditional Chinese stories, Beijing opera, and a desire to portray leftist themes. This
is a widely different cultural and social tradition from the societies that produced the
films Wolfenstein and Leites studied. While Chinese filmmakers may have been inspired
by western films, the divergence in cultural values, political ideology, the role of the state,
and historical events when these films were produced make it challenging to identify the
psychocultural themes in the Chinese films that Wolfenstein and Leites found in the
western films.
What are some of the themes that come out of older Chinese films? Because older films
are so different from modern films, we describe some of the common themes among
older films separately from modern films, later, we will discuss elements of continuity
and their possible significance.
What interested older Chinese filmmakers and their Party patrons?
Revolution as a means of social change
The leftist films of the 1930s and the Communist-era films emphasized the necessity of
revolution to transform society. The films set up an image of the "old society" - explicitly
.......
referring to it as such - and demonstrate how building the "new society" requires
fundamental revolution at the level of the masses. The entire storyline of The Red
Detachment of Women argues to this point. While many of the leftist and communist
films portray revolution as unequivocally positive, the Fifth Generation filmmakers are
more ambivalent - as witnessed by the brutality of the Red Guards during the Cultural
Revolution portrayed in Farewell, My Concubine
Foreigners are not to be trusted
Foreigners, in earlier Chinese film, are portrayed as even more untrustworthy than in
modern film. In some modern films, we observe characters working for foreigners in
professional settings - while potentially rapacious and capitalist, they are not portrayed as
fundamentally evil people. For example, in the Flowers of War, the main character is a
westerner who takes on the duty of protecting a number of Chinese schoolgirls from the
Japanese during the Rape of Nanking. In the earlier films, they are portrayed as
universally evil. For example, a film from as late as the 1980s - The Burning of Yuan
Ming Yuan - portrays what to westerners would appear to be caricatures of foreigners,
intent only on the destruction of China and the Chinese people.
Authority is a stabilizing force for the world, but only when uncorrupted
Authority, as portrayed in modern film, relates to the ability of a central power to impose
stability on a chaotic China. China is portrayed as a large country, which at times was
lawless, that benefited from the imposition of CCP control. Certainly, there are portrayals
of corruption - any of the films dealing with landlords, such as Liu San Jie, portray
landlords are inherently corrupt and evil. Their authority may be stabilizing, but is bad for
the Chinese people (which is the most important thing). The leftist era films do not push
for authority to stabilize the country; their objectives seemed to be purely for some sort of
change from the prior system. The Communist era films, many of them retrospective
looks at the heroism of the Party and Party members, are more overt about the positive
aspects of CCP stability. For example, the Party-produced musical, The East is Red,
comments on this. However, there is less implication that China itself is a chaotic place
by nature; this may be a new theme in the modern film. There are also signals that
authority cannot maintain total control over anything - much of the subtext of Yellow
Earth revolves around how, no matter how hard the Party tries, it will be difficult to
control the earth itself (weather, the rivers, growing patterns, etc).
Sacrifice is noble and often necessary
Sacrifice is a theme that shows up often in earlier films. Sacrifice can be minor -
sacrificing happiness or pleasure for the sake of personal improvement, like in National
Customs, or it could be total, the sacrifice of one's life for a greater cause, like in The Big
Road. This theme has direct continuity throughout modern film.
Family remains the most important thing
Earlier films are ambivalent about the importance of family. In some cases, family
members are set up as foils - with one representing the old China and one representing
the new China, such as in Liu Hulan. Here loyalty to family members is expected - to an
extent - but the greater good is more importa
portant. In The Goddess, the main character
prostitutes herself to support her son's education - a sign that family remains extremely
important in some cases. But in Spring in a Small Town, a woman contemplates leaving
her husband when an old flame resurfaces. The films demonstrate far more variance on
how Chinese should react to family members.
Coping with a new world
Only one film in this sample, This Life of Mine, explicitly examines the experience of an
ordinary Chinese in response to the remarkable social change in China throughout the
early part of the 20" century. Rather than thinking about coping with a new world, the
Chinese, particularly in the Communist era films, are shown as enacting change and
embracing the newness. Since many of the leftist films were intended to create a new
world, the characters are less concerned with coping with the newness; if anything, they
are portrayed as coping with the old world.
Loyalty
Loyalty in Chinese film is a complex subject. One immediate question that arises is -
loyalty to whom? Are individual loyal to their country, their people, their family,
themselves, or to a combination of all of these? A full description of the many ways in
which loyalty manifests is beyond the scope of this analysis, but loyalty is clearly an
important aspect of Chinese culture - given how it shows up in every film in our sample.
One interesting research question might be to understand how perceptions of loyalty have
changed in Chinese media from the inception of the film industry to the present - to what
are people loyal, and why?
Capitalism as a double-edged sword
Early Chinese films portray one side of capitalism - the dangerous side. Landlords,
business owners, and those in power are portrayed as supporting a corrupt system to
enrich themselves and to bolster foreigners. This is evident in films as varied as Liu San
Jie, Street Angel, The Goddess, and Serfs. Capitalism, not surprisingly, is denounced
roundly by these films, which were created under leftist and Communist influence.
Changing social norms in China
Similar to adapting to a new society, the early Chines films focused not on actual
changing social norms in China, but the norms the filmmakers wanted to have changed.
Particularly the leftist films were concerned with the power of landlords and feudalism
and were designed not to show ongoing changes, but strong desires for change.
Interestingly, there are few depictions of the Chinese attempting to adapt to changes in
rule; this should be evident in a film like This Life of Mine, but it is absent.
The importance of duty
Similar to loyalty, an immediate question this raises is - duty to whom? Chinese in these
films are often faced with competing demands for duty. This theme is present in every
film in the sample, and like loyalty, a full description of the important of duty is beyond
this analysis. Suffice to say, duty is on the mind of the ordinary Chinese portrayed in
these films - and indeed even in the minds of the collaborators and landlords - but how it
manifests differs.
The effect of war and violence on people
Conflict is portrayed as debilitating to ordinary people - but only when violence is
committed by the enemy. There are depictions of brutality - such as in The Burning of
Yuan Ming Yuan - but the atrocities are perpetrated by foreigners, the Japanese, or
variously the Nationalists/Communists (depending on the perspective). Violence on
civilians perpetrated by PLA members is nonexistent; indeed the ordinary people
welcome them as saviors. On the whole, this theme shows up far less in the early films as
compared to modern films.
The balance between business and family
This theme is really not evident in the earlier films. In Red Sorghum, business and family
become blended - as the main character operates a liquor distillery with her husband -
but there is not the sense the business and family are separate entities. The same is true in
Yellow Earth, Farewell My Concubine, and The Red Detachment of Women. Business and
family are one in the same in many cases ...:
The point of marriage
Marriages in the earlier films are arranged (Red Sorghum, Yellow Earth); there is little
emotional exploration on the meaning of marriage.
The Chinese West
This theme does not really show up in the earlier films. The focus of the films is on the
coastal regions of China where the revolution occurred. There were certain depictions of
lawlessness/lack of government control - for example in Red Sorghum or Yellow Earth -
so there is some thematic link, but not as explicit as in the more modern films. Moreover,
the films that do have a thematic link only show up in the 1980s.
Fate
There seems to be quite a bit of agency in these films. While individuals may be under
the control of landlords or feudal lords (Serfs), they still have an inner desire to reject
their fate and to overthrow their oppressors. The Chinese people, in these revolutionary
type films, are portrayed as strong if they take agency over their lives. For example, in
The Red Detachment of Women, the main character is a revolutionary who chooses to
escape her feudal lifestyle and to obtain her own vision of China, of course led by the
CCP. In Queen of Sports, the main character is naturally gifted at sports and so expects to
win all competitions; but her fate can only be achieved by her own actions - by working
hard.
Acceptance
As mentioned in the discussion of fate, there is a denunciation of acceptance. Chinese
should not accept their place in life or the circumstances in which they live; they have the
power to change it for the better - preferably through revolution. This is contrast for
modern films, where Chinese tend to accept what happens to this - resignation.
Aimlessness of youth
This theme does not really show up in the earlier films. Chinese youth in early Chinese
film are determined to liberate the people from oppressors; they tend to take on character

roles of young revolutionary firebrands.
Relationship with modern Chinese film themes
There is a much stronger relationship between modern films and the Leitesian themes, as
relaxed censorship standards and less state control in the modern era has led to greater
thematic exploration. There are several, recurring themes seen in the modern films;
themes that cut across Leites' but seem characteristic of Chinese movies
Revolution as a means of social change
Revolution, revolutionary behavior, and rebellion are shown as positive forces for social
change against corrupt governments. Rebels need not have much strength; as long as their
cause is correct, they have the will, and their ideology morally sound, they will succeed
because the people will rise up to support them. In fact, revolution may be considered to
be better than peaceful change, for with revolution, enemies will be destroyed or
marginalized, while with political compromises or elections, that cannot be guaranteed.
Revolution will always be against corrupt officials, and it starts at a small scale but
rapidly gains support.
This is shown overtly in The Founding of a Republic and The Founding of a Party, two
films sponsored by the government to portray the revolution and change in China in a
favorable light. Films also show the benefits of revolution indirectly. Some films portray
gradual change in Chinese society, but 'invariably show that there are downsides to
graduate change: Cell Phone, The Road-Home, Break Up Club, and other films show
Chinese society's gradual westernization and all of the problems associated with it. At
some level, there is a message that a systemic shock would have been better.
Revolution and rebellion are themes as well in multiple films set in the Chinese historical
era. In Hero, The Emperor's Shadow, Curse of the Golden Flower, and White Vengeance
(among others), the plots revolve around "revolution as a means to change corrupt
governments.
Finally, in The Silent Holy Stones, we see another form of rebellion - more subtle. The
film follows a young child living at a Buddhist monastery and his attempts to rebel
against both Buddhist and traditional Tibetan culture to embrace the brave new world
China is entering; the film's message is ambiguous as to whether or not this will be
positive for China.
Foreigners are not to be trusted
Foreigners are represented in historical films to have caused the majority of the strife in
China. Japan and the United States are the big culprits. Foreigners are portrayed as using
China and the Chinese for their own purpose's to the detriment of the Chinese people,
primarily for economic gain. For example, in Bodyguards and Assassins, the ethnic-
Chinese police chief of Hong Kong, on the eve of a visit by Sun Yat Sen in the early
1900s, was specifically told by the British authorities to ignore any conflict between the
Chinese - to let them settle problems by themselves. They are portrayed as exploiting
Hong Kong and the Chinese.
Perhaps the epitome of this type of film is Autobiography of a World War 2 Orphan. This
is an untraditional film; it is a documentary describing the life of a girl orphaned by the
Second World War during the Japanese occupation; her parents were killed and she was
taken in by a peasant family. The resounding message is clear - foreigners in general are
not to be trusted, because the devastation they might wreak on China is immense and this
must be minimized. Unsurprisingly, this film fwas wholly produced by the Bureau for
External Cultural Relations of the Chinese Ministry of Culture.
However, it is somewhat surprising that in many films set in the modern era, Chinese
citizens are seen adopting many foreign habits. Foreign culture and people are sometimes
objects of veneration or desire:
Authority is a stabilizing force for the world, but only when uncorrupted
In some films, authority is found to be a stabilizing force. A strong authority with
hegemony over tianxia (heaven and earth) is one of the only things that brought China
peace - the Qin dynasty - and this fact is referenced in some films. On the other hand, it
is also shown that authority that has become corrupted by power or other influences will
lead to pain and suffering for the people, and this was the case with the KMT and
Japanese during the 1930s and 1940s, leading to the CCP taking power. Politics of this
sort is rarely ever treated in modern era films.
In The Lost Bladesman, for example, the general Guan Yu is separated from the forces of
Liu Bei and must contend with Liu Bei's sworn enemy - Cao Cao. Cao Cao is shown as
being interested in unifying China and imposing order because China (and the Chinese
people) are "messy." They are apt to fight one another and cause trouble, and only with a
strong authority can they be stopped. In cases of weak authority (A Woman a Gun and A
Noodle Shop; Xiao Wu) the Chinese make war, steal from, and generally abuse each other
until an uncorrupt official comes to straighten things out.
Sacrifice is noble and often necessary
Many of these films portray struggles between different groups, necessitating sacrifice for
success. Common people and leaders alike are expected to take risks, sacrifice
themselves, and possibly sacrifice those they love in the name of victory. This is viewed
as a noble and proper task, with the underlying message being that the Chinese people
may have an unusually high tolerance for sacrifice and are particularly resilient. Perhaps
the most evident example of this is the film Sacrifice, where the main character raises an
orphaned child until adulthood for the sole purpose of exacting revenge against a corrupt
King. He sacrifices himself to allow his "son" to land the killing blow.
But sacrifice is not just for at a national level; it can be personal as well. In Lost in
Thailand, a well-meaning (somewhat of a bumpkin) traveler takes great pains to help a
fellow traveler he finds lost in Thailand, although his help is more of a hindrance than
help. In The Flowers of War, both prostitutes and westerners sacrifice in the face of the
Japanese occupation - sacrificing even their lives. .
Family remains the most important thing
Despite some comments below about how the Confucian family is portrayed, generally
speaking, families are still shown to be the most important elements of a person's life.
There is the implication that family members are the only ones you can really trust, and
when you find that you cannot trust your family, there is nothing left for you in the world.
This value resonates in many of the films across all time periods.
In The Road Home, a son leaves his busy city life to return to his home village to bury his
father. In observance of tradition, he organizes a procession to carry his father's coffin
back from the city morgue to where he will be buried, learning more about his father's
courtship with his mother along the way. In a display of filial piety, to respect his
mother's wishes, for one day he teaches the children at the school where his father taught,
making his father's spirit happy that he is remembered.
In A Simple Life, we find that adopted family members matter just as much as true blood.
In this film, a man's maid/cook, who has been with his family since he was a child, passes
away. The film is a flashback of her deteriorating health and how he was steady in
spending time with her and helping her as she passed. The film shows many Chinese as
neglectful of the elderly, but that the right moral thing to do is to always take care of
them.
Coping with a new world
Some films explore the theme of how to cope with the changes coming from a new
world. In these films, the characters have to deal with the possibility of a new order
(societal, economic, etc) coming, how it will change their lives, and in one case, we see
how an individual copes with major changes in life.
For example, in Platform (2009), there are two scenes that highlight this concept. The
film portrays a government/party-run theatre group that travels around Shanxi province
putting on patriotic performances. It is set in the 1970s-1990s in a rapidly changing
China. In a scene early in the film, the troupe members have a party, dancing very
awkwardly with each other. Later on in the film, after troupe members have become more
exposed to the outside world, they are shown once again socializing - this time in a disco,
dancing in a very western manner. The film shows how the characters deal with the
changing world, with some doing well and others not.
In Sunflower, the characters are shown dealing with the changes in Chinese society - first
in the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution, and then after the subsequent economic
liberalization of the 1980s. Family tension is heightened, not lessened, by these changes.
Loyalty
Loyalty is a character trait that common in modern films. Loyalty is presented as a virtue,
and strong bonds of loyalty (e.g., not breaking under torture) are what make groups
successful in their missions. Loyalty to the people, as well as the government, is
emphasized. In contrast, disloyalty to China or the Chinese people is considered to be a
cardinal sin.
In If You are the One and If You Are the One 2, loyalty is not demonstrated in a political
:
or revolutionary context, but in an emotional context. In a man's search for a wife, he
finds that it is ultimately loyalty that means: the most when finding an appropriate
relationship - signaling that some values to: which the Chinese ascribe in the political
realm hold true in the personal realm as well ???
In The Emperor's Shadow, one of the main characters is a musician serving in the
Emperor's court. He owed his life to the Emperor, as when they were young children they
were both held captive by a rival state (prior to Chinese reunification, which was depicted
as a lawless period), and the Emperor pleaded with his captors to spare both of their lives
when they were to be executed. The Emperor's loyalty to him remained firm, but as the
musician realized the Emperor was sinking into tyranny and decadence, he began to
rebel.
Capitalism as a double-edged sword
Capitalism can be portrayed as a double-edged sword for Chinese society and citizens.
Almost all characters in these films agree that China was an incredibly poor country
twenty years ago, and they all agree that capitalism was one of the forces that helped
China grow into the economic powerhouse it is today. Mao even says in The Founding of
a Republic that China "need capitalists." However, they do not all agree that capitalism
has overall been a force for good in Chinese society. Characters working in the business
world are portrayed as greedy, concerned only for making money or their own career
advancement to the detriment of their family or personal lives. The loss of a social safety
net such as the one that existed pre-economic. liberalization is reflected in the struggles of
the main character in The Postmodern Life, of My Aunt to survive in old age, and multiple
characters across films comment on the importance of having sons to support oneself in
old age. And in many romantic films, there is concern over where to find the money to
have a house, or to start a business, complicating life where it used to be much easier.
In Million Dollar Crocodile, capitalism is depicted as having created greed. In the film,
the antagonists seek to kill a giant crocodile for profit - they and other characters
repeatedly risk their lives for it. Only a police officer trying to stop them is shown as
actually caring about something other than money - human life and justice.
Changing social norms in China
There are some signs that filmmakers recognize there are now changing social mores in
China. A couple films show homosexuality and its growing acceptance among the youth
of China; it is not portrayed as something to be shunned or a humiliation, but just as
another part of life that characters seem to accept as normal. Ocean Heaven is a film
about the plight of the developmentally disabled in China. They are portrayed as having
to be independent, with little support from the Chinese government and what little
support they have coming from friends and family. There are also signs of westernization.
In films with young professionals, they are not portrayed as drinking baijiu, the
traditional Chinese rice liquor, but western style red wine. These are all signs that
Chinese society could be shifting toward more of a western, open model, though these are
only preliminary signs and may not be representative of society as a whole.
In Cell Phone, the plot revolves around characters adapting to the introduction of cell
phones in China, which, according to the film-makers, have led to moral decline. The film
emphasizes how overconnection by cell phones and the Internet has made it easier for
spouses to deceive each other in Chinese society. Characters when using phones are
portrayed as perpetually lying, and this being socially acceptable, but emotionally
damaging for their partners.
Sunflower is concerned entirely with changing society. Set in three periods: just after the
Cultural Revolution, the opening of China in the 1980s, and finally the late 1990s when
China began to fully embrace capitalism. It shows how China began to heal from the
Cultural Revolution (the father in the film repeatedly references his time in a labor camp)
and also shows some aspects of Chinese culture that might not be evident to the west - in
one scene, the teenaged main character sneaks away from home to watch a film with his
community in the town center. But despite societal norms shifting over time, one aspect
that did not change was the importance of family in Chinese lives - there are continued
attention to family, marriage, and finding houses throughout the film.
And yet with change there remains continuity - structures social position and status in
China remain. This is evident in the master-student relationship demonstrated in many of
the films, but in business and family contexts as well. Bosses manage, workers work,
fathers lead families, while younger sons obey. Even among social acquaintances this is
true, in the Sorcerer and the White Snake the teacher in the film says to a junior, "You
shouldn't refuse a gift from a senior." In Don't Got Breaking My Heart the CEO of a
financial services firm throws a tantrum and exercises his managerial power to the
extreme after being spurned by a woman - power dynamics for Chinese men seem to
have to be exercised somehow, whether it is in family or public life.
The importance of duty
-
Repeatedly, the theme of duty comes up. There are many different kinds of duty in
Chinese culture, with duty to the Emperor, and crown paramount in the historical era, and
with duty to one's parents and family now paramount in the modern era. In films,
characters repeatedly stray from the path that duty would take them, only to return later
after realizing what truly matters to them. And when characters continue to not fulfill
their duty or even openly flout it, it is because the person to whom they must show that
respect is not fulfilling his or her own duty. This is often the case with rebellions against
emperors or other false leaders. Character's" duty to their families often takes the form of
taking care of their parents in old age, or going to visit them and showing that they care
about them. Duty for children is to provide an education and possibly a house for the
child and his or her spouse in which to live, a sort of reciprocal gift giving scheme that is
an interesting element of Chinese culture. Duty toward one's significant other is rarely
discussed.
The plot of A Railway in the Clouds revolves around the construction of a railway
between Qinghai and Tibet, the highest altitude railroad in the world. The movie opens
with depictions of the first two attempts to build railroads - first by hand in the 1950s and
then with more modern technology in the 1970s. The main character had family members
or friends die during both of those construction attempts, which failed, and leads a third
attempt with a military unit in the early 2000s out of a sense of duty. He even misses his
mother's funeral because he chose to stay at the work site at a critical moment; duty to
country surpasses duty to family.
In For There to be Love, it is portrayed that duty exists not just to one's team, but also
one's society. Four young people, through volunteer work, seek the meaning of love -
there are multiple scenes of the main characters in this movie helping others or coming to
the aid of strangers on the street. Duty extends to one's society as much as it does to one's
close associations.
The effect of war and violence on the Chinese people
Some films explore the effect of war and violence on ordinary people and seek to
understand what people become when exposed to conflict, and why. This is particularly
true for the films looking at Japanese involvement in China during the Second World War.
Japanese soldiers, particularly in The Flowers of War, are portrayed as brutal savages,
reduced to base instincts of human nature, while Chinese soldiers and civilians are
portrayed as innocent and morally upstanding. Several films considering the Chinese
historical period look at war in a similar fashion. The message here may be that war
drives humans to revert to a natural state, with some people morally correct becoming
better people through war and those with naturally "evil" tendencies becoming far worse.
The balance between business and family
With the rise of capitalism in Chinese society, there is a growing delicate balance
between the needs of one's work and the needs of one's family. To be sure, this was
certainly true to an extent even under the command economy, but the way it is
approached in film seems to imply that it is thought of with growing concern. This may
be related to the fact that many Chinese now work for firms with foreign ownership.
Regardless, this interplay is often shown in films, with almost all characters ultimately
choosing family over work. The idea seems to be that family will always be there, while
professional opportunities will come and go.
This is shown in Qin Jia Guo Nian, a film about hear-in-laws celebrating Chinese New
Year with their children, who are dating. The son is struggling in starting a business, and
his girlfriend has sold a house given to her by her mother to finance his idea. With the
parents coming to visit and the business struggling, the film examines the complex
relationship between family and business life, with the ultimate message that family
might not always be the most important; but it should be.
The point of marriage
Many films explore the thinking of characters are they explore the meaning and point of
marriage. Repeatedly, characters ask about the point of marriage, and whether it is better
to marry a friend or someone you love, or whether love at first sight truly exists, or why
people get married at all. All of these films have different answers to these questions, but
in the exploration of what is important, all the characters do agree that it is necessary to
get married no matter what, no matter to whom. Marriage is considered to be the only
way to get a family, which is crucial to Chinese society, and those without marriages are
shunned or considered to be outsiders.
Women get married to men not necessarily because of money or power, but because of
devotion. In I Do, a woman decides to, after the re-emergence of an old boyfriend, to
marry a divorcee who had been emotionally supporting her throughout the breakup rather
than the newly returned, wealthy, ex-boyfriend. In The Locked Door, a woman's returned
lover actively treats her poorly.
The Chinese West
A theme has emerged in Chinese film where they are set in a lawless "Chinese west."
These films are set during historical periods when Chinese emperors or governments had
much less sway over far-flung provinces, and they depict corruption, violence, and
negative human qualities being counteracted by men (or women) of the people who take
righteous stands. An Inaccurate Memoir is an example of this type of film.
In Let the Bullets Fly, Ashes of Time, Design of Death, and Wind Blast, the west is also
portrayed. There is no law - the characters have to make do by themselves, and when
authority figures (police/military) come to employ justice/law, they find resistance from
the residents. These films deal with the struggle between good and evil in lawlessness;
these films assume that in the absence of justice (imposed on an unwilling populace), the
Chinese will lose civilization.
Fate
Some films concern themselves with fate, For example, in The Law of Attraction, there
are short vignettes concerning love, where it appears that it is luck that brings people
together. In The Emperor's Shadow, the Emperor and his young friend are only saved at
the beginning of the film from execution by the intercedence of fate.
Fate works in the opposite direction as well. In Memory of Love, a woman gets into a car
accident with her lover and wakes up with amnesia - but the doctor helping her recover is
her incredibly stoic husband who was shocked to find not only that it was his wife who
was so seriously injured, but also that it was under such circumstances.
Acceptance
Related to the concept of fate is acceptance. Chinese people not only have things happen
to them - exogenous forces operating outside of their control - but when they do, they
deal with it. They are resigned to their fate and once it seems like something cannot
change; they no longer make any effort to escape their situations. In The Postmodern Life
of My Aunt, the main character was reduced to being a vegetable vendor on the street
after a series of calamities and stoically bore 'her fate.
A similar situation is depicted in. Lost in, Beijing - although this film was banned by the
Chinese government for its themes and content. Depicting the aftermath of a rape of a
migrant worker who became pregnant, the main character "Pingguo," who was raped, is
treated as a pawn by her rapist and her husband. Over the course of the film, she becomes
resigned to her fate. But in a move that most Chinese film characters would never
consider, at the close of the film, she collects her child from her rapist's house, a large
sum of money, and walked out the door into the rain. But note that while this film
enjoyed great success outside of China, the government first censored and then cut large
portions of it for its messaging.
Social mobility as a concept is rare. Characters who try for it, like in A Big Score succeed
based only on luck, and in countless. romantio movies ambitious characters are satiated by
love, not by success. Despite the explosions in entrepreneurship in Chinese society over
the last three decades, it remains unclear whether this has fully translated to film - or
what factors prevent it from becoming fully, translated.
Aimlessness of youth
Chinese youth are sometimes depicted as aimless and without direction. In Buddha
Mountain, the film follows three such youth who did not enter college and express their
frustrations over succeeding in a Chinese society where they might be left behind. They
cause trouble, interact with the underbelly of society, and annoy their elders - who view
them as embarrassments. Lost in Beijing has a similar message and has the same director.
Young men are also sometimes shown in film with lives utterly lacking meaning. In The
Breakup Club, the men in the film have little direction - their jobs are dead-ends and it is
hard for them to find relationships. Several other films portray young men in the same
way; women are rarely (except in the above cases and in Xiao Wu) portrayed in such a
fashion.
Fantasy
Fantasy is rare in Chinese film, as are dreams or hallucinations or things that might seem
more common in American or western films. The Sorcerer and the White Snake is the
only film in this group that could be considered purely fantasy, with depictions of magic
and demons. Demons are portrayed are tricksters trying to connive humans into doing
their bidding, while those fighting demons are portrayed as morally upstanding defenders
of the people.
The lack of dreams and fantasy in films other than this is an intriguing point that bears
further consideration from a psychocultural or' psychoanalytical perspective.
Continuity
Is there continuity in Chinese film? Many of these themes do seem to show up in both the
earlier (pre-1990s) and in the modern (post-1990s) films. Common trends include the
importance of revolution, authority, the dangers of capitalism, and sacrifice and duty as
important things Chinese must think about.
What is clear is that there is continuity; what is not clear is why there is continuity.
Continuity could arise from several different factors - there are a few possible reasons for
continuity (these are not all the possible reasons):
Cultural continuity - it is possible that Chinese culture has remained (in large
part) consistent over time, at least in terms of core societal values that might be
represented in mass media. It is possible that Chinese have an underlying national
collective unconscious, whereby they value things like authority, revolutionary
change, and sacrifice. Continuity in these films could be evidence for cultural
continuity - although further evidence could come from examinations of even
earlier Chinese media (classical Chinese literature, folk stories, etc).
Censorship - it may be that Chinese censors throughout the 20""century
supported consistent themes because of political expediency. At the times when
these films were released, it is possible both Nationalist and Communist censors
desired these themes to be shown to, the people - or at least were neutral to their
exposure. This may not always be true, for example, it is unclear why Nationalist
censors would support films agitating. for revolutionary change to fundamental
societal values at the time when they were in power. There is also the additional
question about intent; does it change anything about our interpretation of the films
if the censors intended for certain themes to be let through, versus if they only
allowed themes or were indifferent to them?
Universality - is it possible that the themes demonstrated in these films are
common across time periods because of some sense of universality? Are there
common themes, tropes, characters; and plots that all human cultures value?
Regardless of political situation, government type, economic status, or innate
cultural values, it could be that humans are engineered (adopting an evolutionary
psychology viewpoint) to be naturally predisposed to like authority, or to like
loyalty and duty, or to distrust outsiders, or to advocate for equality. It may be that
these themes are not inherently Chinese, Nationalist, or Communist, but
inherently human.
--
We do not offer firm answers, but only try to raise some questions about how to interpret
these films. All three of the possibilities mentioned above could be "true" - or it may be
possible that a different force entirely is at work
Where there is thematic change - from where does it come? Berry (2004) suggests scenes
of romantic love in modern-era films could be a western import. Chinese filmmakers
certainly observed foreign films after China's economic opening, if not before - whether
those channels were official or unofficial. Scholars remark that Western film theorists
visited China and popularized western ideas about film (particularly the relationship
between film and society/as a reflection of society). Understanding and identifying the
sources of thematic change could inform how Chinese film might change in the future.
If film has changed, this raises an important question - what is Chinese cinema? Should
Chinese cinema be analyzed as a cohesive body? Are there categories of Chinese cinema
that could be interpreted in different ways? If there are different categories of Chinese
cinema, would it then be important to assess the psychology of the characters portrayed
differently? What era of cinema would be most appropriate for certain kinds of analysis?
Chinese cinema is a rich collection of portrayals of China and the Chinese people, but it
is complex enough to warrant serious thinking about how to approach analysis.

6. Broader Character Types
Older Films
Out of the older films emerges a group of characters; some of these can also be found in
the modern films, but these seem to be the most prevalent. As described in the themes, we
see that in early Chinese films, the emphasis is on a dialectic - the fight between the old
society and the new. Particularly for films produced prior to the Cultural Revolution, we
see film plots designed in service of a political message. Due to the need to send a
political message in this way, these films have three main character archtypes: the
enemies, the heroes, and the rest.
Landlord/Capitalist
These characters represent the "old society" the revolutionaries in Chinese film seek to
destroy. These landlords are often portrayed as rapacious;, squeezing every last cent of
profit from their feudal charges, and living lives of luxury and idleness while the peasants
toil on their behalf. They are shown as corrupt and evil, and with so much power that a
single person alone cannot defeat them. Often a revolutionary hero will organize a
collective to overthrow the landlord and institute a new society of equality - economic
and social.
Films: Liu Sanjie, Liu Hulan, The Goddess, This life of Mine, Song of the Fishermen, The
Red Detachment of Women, Serfs, The East is Red
Young revolutionary
The young revolutionary is impressionable and passionate. He or she, for women can also
be freedom fighters, have personally experienced or witnessed injustice at the hands of
the oppressor, whether those oppressors were the landlords and feudal class, the Japanese,
or the reactionaries fighting against the CCP. These characters are always portrayed as the
heroes, and they may sometimes sacrifice themselves for the cause - or they may be the
objects of sacrifice (others sacrificing themselves for the hero). The revolutionary is the
standard-bearer for the construction of the new society, which is a theme that occupies so
many older films.
Films: Liu Sanjie, Liu Hulan, This Life of. Mine, Red Sorghum, The Big Road, Yellow
Earth, The Red Detachment of Women, The East is Red, Serfs
Older bystander
The older bystander is too old to take direct action, and filmmakers use this character as a
tool for exposition. In one film, This Life of Mine, the entire premise of the film is that the
main character has been a bystander for several decades of Chinese history, allowing
viewers to observe history from his perspective. Films are ambivalent about these
characters; sometimes, they may provide advice to main characters, while in other cases
they are only bystanders or servants. As they are used to move plots forward, they do not
occupy much attention.
Films: Queen of Spots, Liu San Jie, Liu Hulan, The Goddess, This Life of Mine, Red
Sorghum, Spring in a Small Town, Farewell 'My Concubine, Yellow Earth, The Red
Detachment of Women, Serfs
Modern Films
Out of the modern films emerges a group of character archetypes that could be reflections
on a broader Chinese society:
Charismatic older leader, morally upstanding
This character is often portrayed as a leader of whatever group is depicted in the movie.
He is older, always male, and speaks from years of experience. He is morally
incorruptible and all who follow him obey orders without question. He is guided by
strong feelings of ideology. He is rarely portrayed as being distracted by things like
women, liquor, or a family. When he indulges in those things, it is as a way of bonding
closer with his comrades, not as a means of release or a distraction. This man is able to
speak in front of a rally of thousands just as easily as he is able to speak to a small group
of intimates. This character, as described in the W+L book, often rescues women -
sexually unawakened.
Films: A Battle of Wits, Bodyguards and Assassins, City of Life and Death, Founding of a
Republic, Lust Caution, The Message, The Founding of a Party, Demon 2, Overheard 2,
Let the Bullets Fly, Kidnap, A Railway in the. Clouds, The Road Home, Flying Swords of
Dragon Gate, The Emperor's Shadow, 1911.
Young revolutionary/firebrand
This character can be male or female but is always young, often a student, an actor, or an
intellectual. He or she is motivated by strong passions of ideology and is always ready to
take direct action on issues that concern them, over the wise counseling of their superiors.
Often, they are portrayed as having some sort of downfall or ruin due to their
hotheadedness, where more careful planning and thinking could have given a better
solution. Unlike the seducer described in the W.+L book, this character accepts sex when
it comes but is more concerned with mission success; seducing young women is not his
priority.
Films: A Battle of Wits, Legend of the Black. Scorpion, Bodyguards and Assassins,
Founding of a Republic, The Message, The Founding of a Party, Platform, The Underdog
Knight, An Inaccurate Memoir, Flying Swords of Dragon Gate
..
Decadent, corrupt official
In many films there are portrayed corrupt government officials, at any level. The corrupt
official could be the Emperor, it could be a local leader, or it could be a military officer.
Their deceptions and corruption often impede protagonist characters, and it is a mix in
terms of whether their corruption is exposed and they are removed.

Turncoat
Out of the main group of protagonists there will sometimes be a turncoat, a traitor who
sells the group to the other side (because there is always another side they are fighting,
showing the idea of Communist dialectic from the Hegelian tradition). The traitor is
motivated by selfish reasons and never totally buys into the ideology of the group he is
with, and his treason hurts the group but is prevented from doing severe damage because
of the strength of the bonds of the rest of the group members and the extent to which they
truly believe in their mission.

Strong woman who meets her demise
Strong female characters are sometimes shown in these films, but they are often shown as
meeting some sort of demise due to their strength. It appears that by being headstrong,
women are more likely to have to, deal with negative consequences and it is implied that
such outspokenness is not a preferred quality among women. These characters are
sometimes vampish - they seek to seduce. men. In some cases they may appear as a good-
bad girl with a veneer of badness. Types like the bad girl or the home-digger are rarely
seen.

Untrustworthy foreigner
Foreigners are never portrayed as trustworthy. They are often shown as being incredibly
disrespectful, uncaring about the plight of suffering Chinese, and interested purely in
their own ends. When Chinese characters approach them for help, they will at first agree,
but then later renege on their promises in a manner that makes them more powerful or
wealthy.

Yuppie
In many films about modern China, young professionals take leading roles. They are all
shown in the same fashion - well-dressed, attractive, with budding careers, and with
money to spend. They are all also shown in turmoil about how their devotion to work
causes problems with their family and friends. They all come back to the fold, dedicating
themselves anew to their families and wives (or husbands), but it takes a great deal of
soul-searching and personal trauma. They are tech-savvy, using the Internet and text-
messaging to communicate, and they adopt western standards of beauty and habits. They
are the new generation of China, but films show them as much for their flaws as for their
promise.

Good employees
In several films, upstart employees try to prove themselves to their bosses, who trust in
them. They could also work for themselves and try to be making it big in the business or
retail world. With the exception of one character in a romantic film who serves as sort of
foil, all Chinese men and women are very good at their jobs, willing to speak out to their
bosses and clients, and willing to work hard to succeed, to the consternation of their
significant others and parents. Bosses take on the role of surrogate parents in the
workplace, serving as mentors, often where their own parents are absent. When bad
coworkers are encountered, good employees empower and inspire them to do better
work.

Confused, lovesick young woman
Confused, lovesick young women populate Chinese romantic films, comedy or drama.
They are universally confused about not only what they want out of life, but also out of a
relationship. They have significant others who they cast aside sometime during the film,
only to return to them toward the end of the film. They spend films thinking about what
life would be like with others, or upset about small slights their boyfriends have
committed while wanting them back at the same time. They ultimately figure out what
the want through a great deal of independent thinking, counsel from family and friends,
and often by a large gesture from the ex-boyfriend who she then takes back. This woman
is not trying to seduce a man (like a vamp), but is looking for true love.

Earnest, not so impressive young man
A new phenomenon in China has been the glut of young men, some educated, with few
career prospects and being content lounging around all day not accomplishing anything.
Or they work odd jobs (often janitorial) and quit at will, revolving through a series of
non-career positions to the dismay of their girlfriends. A couple characters in this vein are
depicted in the films in this sample, and they typically do not redeem themselves except
through hard work and giving in to the interests of their girlfriends and families. This
character might be compared to the standing-offer man from the W+L book - who is
always around to help but regularly loses the girl. He is close to the man-as-child as
described by W+L.

Own.
Woman who needs rescuing
In many films, women are shown as needing rescue. Whether this rescue is from
themselves or from others, women are often seemingly incapable of taking care of
themselves. In one particular example, a woman tries to commit suicide by jumping into
the ocean, only to be rescued by some fisherman and awaking to see her suitor in front of
her, who spends the rest of the film (and the sequel) trying to help her heal and to win her
heart. Of course, he ends up succeeding. She is purely a good girl - unlike the good-bad
girl in the W+L book. She actually, is an idealized representation of a Chinese woman.

Caring outsider
Caring outsiders often help main characters in need of aid. These outsiders may be a
neighbor, a distant relative, a coworker, or even a significant other, but there is a clear
sense of community in Chinese film. Main characters do not live by themselves in a
vacuum, they inhabit a world where they can call upon others for help, and they will
respond even when the government does not. They serve as deus ex machinas in the films
themselves - plot devices - but their presence may signal a broader existence in Chinese
society.

Plot devices
There are several common plot devices in older Chinese films that help filmmakers tell
their stories. These include:
Persecution
Characters in many of the older films are persecuted, typically by members of the "old
society," government officials, foreigners, or invaders. It is common to show heroes as
persecuted, by their enemies - they do not always come back and defeat them.

Burning of Yuan Ming Yuan, The Horse ThiefinRed Sorghum, Farewell My Concubine,
Yellow Earth, The Red Detachment of Women, Street Angel, Serfs, The Red Detachment
of Women
Overt political statements
There are scenes where characters do not quite break the fourth wall, but deliver what
appear to be very direct political messages, in particular arguing for the destruction of the
old regime and the institution of the new society. These are sometimes jarring - they may
not always "flow" with the film, and it is obvious when the political message has been
shoehorned in.

Small Town, Farewell My Concubine, The Big Road, Song of the Fishermen, Yellow
Earth, Street Angel, The Red Detachment of Women, The East is Red, Serfs
Battling China's enemies
Given the political message in these films, there are repeated scenes and plot devices
revolving around fighting China's enemies, After initial defeat, the revolutionaries who
fight for China's new future are invariably\ successful. There will typically be a
triumphant scene where the revolutionaries win a major battle - or in another style, there
will be a major scene of sacrifice, followed by a follow up describing how the
revolutionaries went on to win ..:

Sorghum, Farewell My Concubine, The Big Road, The Red Detachment of Women, The
East is Red
There are a number of common plot devices in modern films that help filmmakers tell
their stories:
Catching a significant other in the act
Some amount of voyeurism and watching from afar is evident in many romantic films.
Often, a boyfriend or girlfriend will watch from afar as their significant other cheats on
them or engages in behavior they do not like. Sometimes they stumble on this on their
own volition, other times they are led there by friends. There is sometimes an angry
confrontation after catching a significant other in the act, leading to the couple splitting
for a period before recognizing that both had made mistakes and returning to one another.
Imperial proclamation
One way that Chinese directors and writers of historical films move plots along is by
using imperial proclamations. In these scenes, the Emperor, or an equivalent male
authority figure, addresses a large body of his retainers, directing them toward some task.
Often there will be a retainer who objects to the order, resulting in his expulsion or
execution. The Emperor will stay calm throughout most of the session, but will
occasionally fly into a rage at the reticence of his retainers in carrying out his orders.
Scene of sacrifice
Sacrifice is a recurring theme in Chinese film, so it is no surprise that scenes of sacrifice
routinely show up in films across genres. It can happen in a tense moment where a
character must sacrifice himself (to the death) for success in battle (like in Red Cliff), or it
can happen over the course of a film where a character spends an entire lifetime
sacrificing for the good of someone else (like in Ocean Heaven). No matter the form, the
intent is always the same: by giving up one's own life or happiness, one can ensure the
happiness, success, or survival or another.
Activities done in "new China"
In the "new China," characters drink western wine, enjoy electronic media, use the
Internet, eat western food in restaurants, and travel abroad. In films set in the modern era,
nearly all characters do this to some extent, and these activities seem to have supplanted
more traditionally Chinese activities depicted in historical epics (reading, bettering
oneself, drinking rice wine, etc).
The problem is that these scenes are probably utterly unrelateable for most Chinese, even
young professionals. Ordinary Chinese cannot book flights across the ocean on a whim,
nor could they necessarily afford the kinds of meals or products these characters enjoy.
While these are supposed to portray "ordinary life" in a richer China, the reality is far
from what is depicted. What then, would be the draw of showing these scenes over and
over again in so many films?
The significant other making a serious mistake.
Somewhat related to the discussion of; watching a significant other with someone else,
lovers in Chinese romantic films often make egregious mistakes in the eyes of their
significant others. These cause the couple to split, only to be reunited later after
apologizing for the mistake.
Suicide
Suicide is sometimes depicted in Chinese film, with main characters attempting, but
never succeeding, at committing suicide. Their motives are for love, in the two cases in
this sample because they love someone too much. They are always rescued by someone
or something outside of their control, and they spend the remainder of the film healing
and vowing not to try that again. It is somewhat surprising that Chinese films are so blunt
about the topic of suicide, although the fact that none of the characters ever actually die
from it is probably indicative of just how accepting they actually are.
Finding self by going home
There is an obsession with returning to one's laojia, one's hometown in the Chinese
countryside, or with having the laojia come back to them. Reconnection with the place of
one's birth, the family still living there, and the memories had there help characters in
these films to find themselves and to overcome problems they have in life. They become
reinvigorated through their travel to their laojia and better understand who they are. This
plot device, of a character returning home, appears often.
Airport scene
Another curious phenomenon is the proliferation of scenes of people running to and from
airports, almost always chasing after a significant other who is about to depart. It is
typically the male chasing after the female in the relationship, breathlessly catching up
with her at the very last minute as she departs for a far-off destination that would take her
away from him for an extended period. She almost always agrees to stay with him, or at
least, to remember him while she is gone.
The drunk woman
There seems to be a common scene where a young woman, distraught over losing a
boyfriend or husband, will drink an incredibly quantity of alcohol in a plea for attention.
When in public she will find a man nearby to take care of her and to take her home - in
these films Chinese men are invariably honorable to the point of taking her home without
problems. When in private, she will call over a close male friend to commiserate about
the love. These are used as scenes to introduce the woman to an eligible man, who will
then start courting her.
Family dinner
Food is central to Chinese culture and social interaction, so it is no surprise that many
films include scenes of communal dining - family dinners or outings to restaurants are
very common. Even the act of purchasing food leads to human connections - as the
characters remark in Eat Drink, Man Woman "man, woman, food, sex" are basic facts of
humanity that they cannot escape. These scenes are used as settings for important
announcements or for drama to occur between participants.
Relationships
There are few recurring relationships showing up in the older films. This is not to say
there are not significant relationships - the mother's relationship with her child in The
Goddess is quite important, as is the young revolutionary's relationship with her mentor
in The Red Detachment of Women. These relationships are meaningful to the characters
and they matter for the messages the films try to tell. However, there do not seem to be
systematic relationships that appear across many films. The characters in these films have
relationships idiosyncratic to the film they are in.
This may seem strange, given that the early films do not exhibit thematic variation. Why
would there not be recurring relationships when there are recurring stories? While there is
thematic invariance, the stories are told in different ways. With the variety of means
filmmakers tell stories, we may not expect the same characters to show up.
Moreover, there is a far more explicitly political angle to many of the earlier films. These
films tell a story not about the relationships between the characters, but about how the
characters further the political message of the film. Relationships are arguably less
important; they serve a plot purpose, but in themselves may not have significance. One
might conceive of the main characters - especially the protagonists - having relationships
not with other characters, but with the broader cause with which they identify, or with the
Chinese nation generally.
There are some recurring relationships that show up in the modern films as well:
Father-son
The father-son relationship is actually rarely shown in this sample of films. Among films
set in the modern era, it is shown in Qin Jia Guo Nian, a film about two sets of in-laws
meeting during Chinese New Year. There, the relationship is akin to a emperor and
subject, with the father reminding the son of his duty to the family and his wife, and
taking charge during an awkward moment during the week. In historical films, the father-
son relationship is also shown as one of duty, with several examples of the Emperor's
sons obeying (or disobeying) him as duty commands.
Father-daughter
The father-daughter relationship is shown as primarily being one of protection. Fathers
are supposed to look out for their daughters even after they grow up and get married, with
the understanding that the daughters will continue to cherish and love them well into old
age. Surprisingly, fathers are also often absent in Chinese films, having died or been
divorced, leaving only the mother to raise the daughter. It is the father's responsibility to
approve of or to give advice on the choice of husband.
Husband-wife
Husbands and wives have varied relationships in Chinese film, but all relationships
revolve around the central question of the point of marriage. Why get married? Who to
marry? These questions are recurring issues that plague relationships in these films. There
is also the question of lost loves; in some films, husbands or wives go out to seek their
lost loves upon reaching old age, to wonder about what could have been. But these are
distractions or interludes, as the vast majority of the time husbands and wives are
:
:
characterized by devotion to one another over all else. The same cannot be said for
people in just regular relationships; it seems the label of marriage in film adds some
seriousness to relationships even though this seriousness may not always be practiced in
reality.
Mother-son
Mothers are protective toward sons, often thinking their son's wives or girlfriends are
unacceptable or not good enough for them. Mothers also are greatly concerned about
their sons' safety and future, willing to; sacrifice to ensure a happy future and always
worrying about their safety wherever theyare: In return, sons are devoted to their
mothers, and when they make mistakes that would make their mothers upset, they always
return to apologize and continue doing their duty. In one case, a son (a criminal) was so
concerned for his mother that he went to visit her every day in the nursing home when his
father (and her husband) died. He ultimately hatched a scheme that would enrich the
nursing home to provide his mother with a steady and happy future.
Mother-daughter
The mother-daughter relationship is also protective, but mothers are more willing to take
drastic action to ensure their daughters will have good lives to the tune of buying houses
or negotiating directly with boyfriends. They are overly concerned with their daughters'
relationships and want her to find the man who would provide her the best life possible.
In other respects, mothers' relationships with their daughters are similar to the mother-son
relationship referenced above.
Boss-worker
Bosses are often protective of those who work for them, mentoring and helping them out
whenever they can. The idea of the boss or manager asking workers to do too much or
being not nice in really any way is unheard-of, and workers repay their bosses' kindness
with work that is high in both quality and volume. There is some element of a parental
relationship with this, as bosses will step in as father (nearly always male) figures to help
take care of their workers when parents are not near.
Confucian family relationship commonly shown as flawed
There are also some relationship archetypes shown in these films. One of these is the
unhappy marriage - unhappy husbands and wives are shown fairly often. This is related
to the idea of the Confucian family structure in general, with the husband/father in charge
of a family unit and all others within it needing to obey his words. The Confucian type is
shown often in the historical films, with the father lording over his children, his wife, and
his other subordinates. This is shown as being a negative thing, and the father is
chastened or has to learn how to deal with a more reasonable structure that treats
members more as equals.
Boy-Girl
Apart from traditional family relationships, Chinese films often portray romantic
.......
relationships. I refer to these as "boy-girl relationships," because they are almost always
between an unmarried couple acting in immature ways. When married couples are
shown, they are somewhat troubled (ex: Cell Phone, with the husband's incessant lying
and cheating). Unmarried couples are often portrayed as having met long before the film
began. In established relationships, they are often challenged as the film goes on - by
events outside of their control, by new emotions, by new people. There is a strong
deterministic message, that people do not choose who their partner will be, it will be a
natural match or not. Couples may not seem like innate matches at first, and films often
trace their path of discovering that one way or the other.
Mentor-Student
The mentor-student relationship comes up in a few films. Students may not always be
students in the traditional sense. In Ocean Heaven, the relationship is between a father
and a son, where the father is trying to teach his son about being a good person. In
Together, there is a more traditional relationship between a violin student and teacher.
Students are expected to respect and obey their mentors at all times, but if their mentors
take advantage of them or lead them down a path that would violate any Chinese morals
(for example, neglecting one's family), they are fully justified in leaving and disobeying
them.
7. Characters and Themes fitting Leites
Characters
Older Films
Woman rising due to own abilities - The Red Detachment of Women
The entire premise of The Red Detachment of Women is that women can be just as
effective revolutionary fighters. The women in this film, particularly the protagonist,
have all been treated poorly by the Nationalists and the landlords they support. They
spend large amounts of time training, drilling, and planning for attacks against Nationalist
columns, in part drawing knowledge from male CCP members, but primarily working on
their own. They become an effective fighting unit based almost entirely on their own
innate abilities and determination.".
The heroine as mother - The Goddess"
The heroine is shown as a mother in The Goddess; similar to American movies, the father
is absent. While the son is not shown to grow up in this film, we see the heroine sacrifice
everything - even her freedom, as she is imprisoned for prostituting herself to support
him. The son's father is never mentioned in the film, nor is any other of the heroine's
family; she is entirely alone and her story revolves around her struggles to support him.
Suffering stars - Farewell My Concubine
!
In Farewell My Concubine, the plot revolves around two professional performers. Leites
describes the characters in their sample as having careers fraught with danger; this is
certainly the case with the two Beijing opera stars in Farewell, who suffer persecution at
the hands of the Japanese and the Communists. In Leites' world, the preference was for
those who look - rather than act. This leads to catastrophic results when they act, much
like the results we see in Farewell .:
Modern Films
There are also some examples of characters and themes fitting Leites' original archetypes
from his Movies volume, as well as from his paper On Violence in China. While not all of
the original examples fit, due to vast differences in culture and setting, there are still some
persistent characters that could reflect some underlying aspects of the human experience.
Woman rising due to own abilities - The Postmodern Life of My Aunt
A trope Leites described in his book was the example of a woman rising in stature or
ability due to her own abilities and not due to marriage or favor from someone else. The
independent woman does not need a man or benefactors to be successful at her career.
She pulls herself up by her bootstraps and uses her innate intelligence, cunning, and
dedication to make it in the world without the assistance of men. This is true in The
Postmodern Life of My Aunt, the main character is an older woman who lives alone in
Shanghai, who has never married and supports herself through teaching English to the
children of wealthy Shanghai residents. She came from poverty in northern China and
was able to be successful in the world by virtue of her education and abilities in working
with others around her. Repeatedly in the film, she demonstrates how well she is able to
succeed on her own, though the last half of the film deals with her ultimate downfall.
Man rising due to fluke - Bodyguards and Assassins
While women are portrayed as rising due to, their own innate abilities, Leites noted that
sometimes men are portrayed as having succeeded due to fluke or chance. In Chinese
cinema this is mostly shown with worthless sons being raised to power or status by virtue
of their fathers. In Bodyguards and Assassins, one of the main male characters is the son
of the wise leader figure, who happens to be very wealthy. At the beginning of the film,
he was accepted to Yale University, but it seems that he was accepted more due to his
father's influence, wealth, and ability to hire tutors rather than innate desire or ability.
Portrayed as a privileged son of wealth, he redeems himself at the end of the film by
sacrificing himself for the sake of a revolutionary cause.
Masculine girl - Bodyguards and Assassins
Leites noted that female characters were sometimes portrayed with masculine tendencies
or characteristics. This happens in Chinese film occasionally. In Bodyguards and
Assassins, the main female character was a tomboy, learning martial arts and unwilling to
become emotionally close to any other characters. In Chinese film the masculine girl is
not a love interest, but becomes like a stand-in for another male. She is a novelty, not a
central player.
Suicide due to frustration in love -Legend of the Black Scorpion
Suicide due to frustration in love was a theme in the films Leites watched. When one or
more major characters were continually frustrated by their relationships, they would kill
themselves to avoid dealing with the trauma. In this sample, it happens in Legend of the
Black Scorpion, which was based on Shakespeare's Hamlet. In this film, the sitting king
had just killed his brother to take both the kingdom and his brother's wife for himself.
Through a series of machinations, his wife, his son, and others in the court conspired to
kill him, but he had by that point truly fallen in love with his new wife. Upon discovering
the plot and his wife's desire to kill him, he became distraught and killed himself rather
than live with the knowledge that the woman he loved felt so negatively toward him.
Private eye - A Woman, A Gun, and A Noodle Shop
The private eye character is noted by Leites as one who is contracted to solve a mystery.
There are relatively few examples of this in Chinese film, but the closest one appears in A
Woman, A Gun, and A Noodle Shop. This film is set in the Chinese imperial era, and the
main antagonist, the owner of a noodle shop, hires a local police official to murder his
wife and her lover. In this course of this mission, the police official undertakes sort of a
private investigation of his own in an attempt to further enrich himself. He thinks about
the best way to steal money from the antagonist, discovering through investigation where
he keeps his money and creating a plan for taking it. Private eyes are a character
archetype that may have been popular in the 1940s, when Leites watched film noir films
from American cinema, but it does not appear they are too popular in modern Chinese
cinema.
On Violence in China
Leites' On Violence in China is a collection of quotes from various Chinese sources that
seeks to illustrate the Chinese mindset toward violence - in the four chapters completed,
Leites examines the phenomenon of taking oneself as a target, making oneself as a target
for others, pursuance, and yielding to an enemy (and enemies yielding to oneself). While
in modern Chinese films, overt violence exists primarily in war films (street violence or
interpersonal violence is rare) there are still a number of quotes that correlate with some
themes from the films - even working in the 1960s-1970s, there are some areas where
Leites was able to identify some (seemingly) enduring features of Chinese culture.
Early Films
There are several areas where Leites' themes from the piece are exhibited in older films.
Leites discusses Communist feelings on self-destructiveness, namely, he argues there are
four rules the Communists apply to damaging oneself:
"(1) that the individual should be willing to let the Party's (instead of the family's
or the ruler's) enemy inflict damage on him, as the price to be paid for his hurting
the enemy on the Party's behalf;
(2) that he should avoid any damage to himself not profitable to the Party-the
theme corresponding to the classical one stated above and, as I just noted, now
muted;
(3) that the (pen-)ultimate objective is not, as of old, avoidance of destruction, but
rather its accomplishment with regard to the enemy;
and (4) that the Party knows how to reduce the cost to itself of attaining this
objective." (Leites, 1970, 219):
There are many examples of these themes in film - as these are actually the central stories
behind the revolutionary films the Communist Party promoted about itself and its conduct
during the Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War. Certainly in films like The Red
Detachment of Women, The East is Red, Liu Hulan, and other films set during the
Communist Era.
Violence need now always be violence. Violence can come not just from overt attacks on
others, but from deprivation and exploitation. Leites cites the example of landlords:
"The bloody facts are that the paradise of landlords, rich peasants and a fortune
without murdering the poor people." This is the catchword for making a fortune
among the landlords, rich peasants and capitalists" (Leites, 1970, 223)
This is, of course, a major theme in films like Liu Sanjie, which attribute much of the
Chinese people's dissatisfaction with their state in lives to the exploitation and rapacity of
the landlords, the upper classes, and the traitors who support them. Toiling for another
without reaping the benefits of that labor is akin to having violence inflected on oneself.
A theme Leites cites - namely, the Chinese fear of a dangerous and destructive world - is
prevalent in film. Leites suggests "[i]n traditional China this feeling was strong: almost
anything I do may provoke somebody's rage and induce him to strike at me" (Leites,
1970, 221), and "[w]hen another harms me, I might with notable ease not consider the
possibility that he is doing it without awareness or with indifference: it is with
intent" (Leites, 1970, 222). In films, characters'are generally concerned about the world -
they are concerned for the number of enemies that appear, seemingly out of nowhere, to
challenge the broad masses of the Chinese people. These enemies, like the landlords, hate
the Chinese - "" 'Hatred' and 'revilement represented the common language of all the
landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries; undesirable characters, and rightists ... in
China at that time," recalls People's Daily about 1962 in the summer of 1966. "They
really harbored 'deep hatred' towards the Communist Party ... gnashed their teeth and
poured out abuses." (Leites, 1970, 223): This is a basic fact: that China's enemies are
numerous, the world exists in a dangerous condition, Chinese enemies are opposed to the
very existence of the Chinese people, and that the only way to defeat the enemy is to
inflict violence.
:
Is there ambivalence about the destruction of one's enemy? How far should the fight
against the enemy be taken? In early Chinese film, there is a strong emphasis in the utter
destruction of the enemy - again and again film characters are seen chanting about the
destruction of the old society, and that the only way for the new society to be built - a
new society built on equality and freedom Y'is for the old to be utterly smashed. We see
this not just in conflict against landlords; but also against the Japanese and the
Nationalists. In the Communists' view - at least in film - the dialectic was established
such that failure to utterly destroy would lead to the enemy's reemergence.
Leites suggests there is ambivalence about the Communist desire to destroy the enemy
utterly. Even Mao tended towards "the classical Chinese belief: sometimes he implicitly
denies the desirability, and even the feasibility, of annihilating the enemy" (Leites, 1970,
228). The films do not follow this line; they follow the argument that "[t]he existence of
some badness fosters the very combat of the good against it" (Leites, 1970, 228). To
combat evil is to destroy it - there is no need, in the view of the film characters, to hold
back.
Leites also discusses how enemies may be hidden - of course, tying back in to the idea of
deception as an underlying current in Chinese society. He suggests, "enemies, usually
protected by false appearances, should be given time and facilities to reveal their 'true
form" (Leites, 1970, 237). This is not the case in the films. In the films - particularly any
films related to struggle against enemies the enemies are clear. The enemies are the
landlords and oppressive classes or the foreign invaders rampaging around China; there is
no need to let the enemies show themselves because they are so obviously present.
Moreover, Leites cites evidence that traditional Chinese do not pursue to the extreme.
Rather, when they respond to enemy attacks, their tit "should not exceed a fair proportion
to the enemy's "tat" -for reasons which are not given; as if the fear of irritating the
enemy were making itself felt. "After repulsing one . . . attack," Mao requires in the
situation just evoked, "we should know when to stop. . . . " (Leites, 1970, 239). Liberation
fighters in Chinese films only stop when they cannot proceed any further - they stop
because circumstances require it (not enough force), but they always want to continue to
attain the complete destruction of the enemy. There is no desire for there to be balance -
the presence of the dialectic means balance between the opposing sides would go against
nature; the natural, correct state is for the Chinese side to prevail. Any kind of tit for tat or
proportional response would prevent nature from rebalancing itself and go against the
natural order.
While there does appear to be some alignment with the Leitesian themes - there seems to
be difference as well. Namely, a number of themes of violence Leites cites - for example,
not pursuing one's enemy to total destruction - seem to be supported by the evidence
Leites cites and by contemporaneous quotes, by Mao and other party members. Why then,
would we not see those similar themes in the films - particularly films from this era,
which are supposed to be representations of Party messages to be sent to the people?
There might be multiple reasons. First, there could be an error in interpretation at three
levels: errors in interpreting the older films, Leites committing an error in making
:
1
:
statements about Chinese society from a limited data sample, or an error in the author
interpreting Leites.
Conditional on correct interpretations (on all sides), what might be other reasons for the
divergence? It is possible that Party members have private or public thoughts - as
expressed through their speeches or interviews. It is also possible that they hold different
views that they wish the people (on the whole) to believe. That is, while Party leaders
may privately believe (and be influenced by traditional literature in believing) that China
should not overreach with its enemies. At the same time, it may be convenient for them
(and the Party generally) for the people to believe the opposite - that the common people
need to unite and ensure that China's enemies are unilaterally destroyed.
Modern Films
There are also themes that are exhibited in the modern films.
Leites' On Violence in China is a collection of quotes from various Chinese sources that
seeks to illustrate the Chinese mindset toward violence - in the four chapters completed,
Leites examines the phenomenon of taking oneself as a target, making oneself as a target
for others, pursuance, and yielding to an enemy (and enemies yielding to oneself). While
in modern Chinese films, overt violence exists primarily in war films (street violence or
interpersonal violence is rare) there are still a number of quotes that correlate with some
themes from the films - even working in the 1960s-1970s, there are some areas where
Leites was able to identify some (seemingly) enduring features of Chinese culture.
Leites emphasizes violence against oneself: a" prevailing theme in many of the quotes
from his sources as well as in modern fine
Im. Leites describes a Chinese culture oriented
around rage and violence that does not exist in modern film. "Suddenly," in The Dream of
the Red Chamber, the central character (young Pao-yu), possessed, "leaped three or four
feet into the air and began to jabber words that no one could understand .... He dashed
about wildly ... apparently bent on self-destruction ...
Soon the news spread throughout
both mansions .... " (Leites, 1970,4). This would be utterly unheard of in modern Chinese
film - while rage does occur (for example in Go LaLa Go!), fighting is somewhat
symbolic and does not yield a resolution - one resolves (interpersonal) conflicts through
talk, not through violence. Fighting as described by Leites here yields desired outcomes -
or at least some outcomes. Leites focuses on destruction and rage in many of the quotes,
but their applicability to modern Chinese film is dubious in many cases.
1
But violence as manifested in self-harm is a common feature in Chinese film (ex: If You
Are the One 2). Leites describes self-mutilation: "Before Wang could interfere," imagines
a T'ang writer, "Ku raised his sword and cut off his own head" (Leites, 1970, 5). In
Chinese film, self-harm is less physical - but comes from substances, emotions, mental
health, and trust. Self-harm does not result in physical death but emotional. And as Leites
describes self-punishment - for example: "Strike the wretch for lying!" she commanded.
Wang-erh, one of her favorite servants, came up to carry out the command, but Phoenix
stopped him, saying, 'Let him'strike himself. "Your turn will come next." (op. cit., pp.
422-423)" (Leites, 1970, 7) - this is less prevalent in modern Chinese film.
Marriage is a concern. Leites reports that a farmer's son having, in the 1920's, refused the
wife selected for him, "his father told him that unless he married, he would kill him, or
kill himself" (Agnes Smedley, Chinese destinies. New York, 1933, p. 6)" (Leites, 1970,
2). That is to say, marriage is a concern both in the sense that parents continue (to this
day) to want to have their children married, while children sometimes push back - or
acquiesce under duress. But in modern Chinese film, there is more passion for marriage
than duress - unlike this quote (see any romantic film produced in the last decade). Of
course, with respect to cheating in a relationship, the feelings expressed in the following
quote still exist in film: "Phoenix ... threw herself at Chia Lien, crying that he might as
well kill her then and there, since he wanted to get rid of her," (Whereupon, unusually,
"Chia Lien ... seized a sword from. the wall, and said he would gladly oblige if she
insisted.")" (Leites, 1970, 9).
Family is also important, to the point where Leites finds that brothers are unwilling to
report on each other: "The elder brother," discloses another such story, "knowing that he
was in the wrong and could not report the case (against his younger brother, never mind
which-NL), was very angry." Then, though "Chuan saw that his brother was very
angry" and - probably sensing the danger not to the target, but to the bearer of that
feeling - "kowtowed and apologized," "the brother hanged himself" (T'ung-tsu Ch'u:
Law and Society in Traditional China, Paris, 1965, p. 59)" (Leites, 1970, 2-3). Here, the
sense of duty to one's family is similar but still different. Chinese films actually rarely
how siblings (Echoes of a Rainbow is a notable exception); but when families are shown,
they have a sense of duty and obligation that help to keep them together - but they are
rarely so upset about it as in this case.
Leites' comments on political aspects tend to be true. Although modern Chinese film is
oriented heavily around the theme of sacrifice (ex: Sacrifice), Leites notes that at least in
1970, he identified the Communists as trying to reducing the cost of attaining objectives:
""Local ... guerrillas," reports Agnes Smedley about the war against the Japanese, "who
had formerly fought under the slogan of 'Kill Japanese, then die,' were taught by the New
Fourth Array training camp how to 'kill Japanese and live" (Battle Hymn of China, New
York, 1943, p. 261)" (Leites, 1970, 13). He-finds Communists as "chary" in mentioning
the penchant to do self damage.
However, with respect to overall mindset toward the world, the Communists seem to
have the same general mindset as modern Chinese films. In film, characters view the
world as messy and dangerous, that not only will fellow citizens/people seek to do harm,
but that this hostility will be reflected in the broader international geopolitical system.
This led, Leites argues, to conservatism: "don't do anything to cause men to frown at you,
and there will not be a man to grind his teeth at you" (a proverb quoted in Scarborough's
collection, op. cit., p. 315)" (Leites, 1970, 16). The feeling at the time seemed to be
conservative and wary of provoking others. "if you want your dinner, don't offend the
cook"(loc. cit., p. 93)" (Leites, 1970, 16). Also: "Only fools catch flies on a tiger's head,"
opines a character in The Scholars. "Much better to say nothing and offend nobody" (Wu
Ching-tzu, The Scholars, Peking, 1959, p. 116)" (Leites, 1970, 38).
The world, in this world, is murderous: "The power," says Ou-yang Hsiu (11th century)
in a famous passage about the season of autumn, "by which it lays waste and scatters far
and wide is the unexpended fury of the breath of heaven and earth. For autumn is the
minister of punishments .... Its purpose is .:. execution" (Anthology of Chinese literature,
compiled and edited by Cyril Birch and Donald Keene, New York, 1965, p. 373)" (Leites,
1970, 17).
With respect to interpersonal relationships; Leites found that even when people try to
help, it could have been construed as hurting: "Black Jade threw up all the medicine she
had just taken and much more besides ... coughed until it seemed that her lungs would
burst," her devoted maid "Purple Cuckoo hurried to her and began to pound her back to
relieve her"; but Black Jade pushed her away saying, ' ... Go get a rope and strangle me. It
will suit your purpose better" (The Dream of the Red Chamber, pp. 351-352)" (Leites,
1970, 18). This shows up in Lost on Travel and Lost in Thailand - where well-meaning
attempts by a character to provide help as construed as materially dangerous by another.
But because of the hateful world, Leites finds that when Chinese think about their
enemies, they show only hatred. "With hatred carved in his bones ... ," a "rebel"
publication says in standard fashion about Peking's deposed boss (P'eng Chen) (Current
Background, No. 874, p. 16); "the faces and eyes of these ... bandits were burning
with ... hate against the revolutionary rebels," one such group may say about its rivals (loc.
cit., No. 861, p. 25)" (Leites, 1970, 19). This is consistent with how the enemy - typically
the Japanese - are portrayed in Chinese film, with the oppressed Chinese truly showing
them hate (Shanghai, The Flowers of War); the enemy is portrayed as inhuman: "when
you want to attack someone, is to give him a label or 'nickname.' This is the method
used ... since the Ming and Ch'ing dynasties. If for instance you want to accuse Chang or
Li, they will seem too normal if you just use their names; but if you call them 'six-armed
demon Chang' and 'Li the white-browed tiger" the magistrate need not examine the facts
to be convinced they are scoundrels" (Leites, 1970, 25). Or: "She was not a human being;
she was a wicked infamous beast! Why let such a creature survive?" (Wen Kangs Die
schwarze Reiterin, Zurich, 1954, p. 250)" (Leites, 1970, 28). Leites, however, notes that
the Communists "deny, in opposition to the Confucians, that a "human nature" exists:
only class natures do" (Leites, 1970, 25).
Leites expends considerable attention on pursuit - the question of whether, upon
defeating or routing an enemy, to pursue him and to annihilate him. His evidence is
mixed; certainly, there is a strain of quotes arguing not to destroy: "the altars of the fallen
dynasty were not destroyed, but merely walled in ... [for] one foresaw that the type of
civilization
whose memory ... and " seed they preserved, would return"
(pp.
99-100)" (Leites, 1970, 30). Leites notes that even Mao implicitly denies that destroying
the enemy is desirable. The goal is struggle is not the same as the goal of destruction. The
dialectic requires the opposition to exist in order to be strengthened: "That erroneous
things ... exist," explains Mao, "will help people learn to struggle against them
better" (March 12, 1957, Speech at the Chinese Communist Party's National Conference
on Propaganda Work, Peking, 1966, p. 26)" (Leites, 1970, 31). This is in line with the
thinking on film; attackers seek to co-opt their enemies rather than to utterly destroy them
- for example in Red Cliff, the opposing forces look for opportunities to encourage
defection that might serve to strengthen. During the Japanese occupation and ensuing
civil war, while sentiments toward the Japanese were high - there was never talk of
pursuing the Japanese back to the home islands, only to get them out of China. Mercy/
chivalry, as in film, were major features: "some comrades consider it too much to trample
on enemies who have already been knocked down .... They show mercy to
them" (Chekiang Radio, July 20, 1967¿ Union Research Service, August 25, 1967, p.
219)" (Leites, 1970, 33).
However, Leites also presents evidence to show that Maoists are in favor of annihilation
- because of fear. In response the Duke said:"In one morning I exterminated three of the
six nobles. I cannot bear exterminating all of them.' 'Your Highness cannot bear
exterminating them, but they will bear causing Your Highness harm,' said Ch'ang Yu-
chiao. To this the Duke would not listen. In the course of three months, the remaining
nobles started a rebellion and ... killed Duke Li ... " (Chapter 31, op. cit., Vol. 2, pp.
6-7)" (Leites, 1970, 44). If one does not annihilate enemies, they will come back to cause
harm - this theme is not apparent in the films.
Finally, Leites describes the prospect of yielding. Mao, in describing his upbringing,
learned: "I learned that when I defended my rights by open rebellion, my father relented,
but when I remained meek and submissive, he only cursed and beat me the more" (loc.
cit., p. 126)" (Leites, 1970, 50). Yielding denies one of the rights he might otherwise
have; in China film, heroes rarely ever surrender. In Hero, rather than surrendering, the
main character chooses death after rebellion. But when Leites goes on to describe the tit-
for-tat strategy the taken by the Communists this is not seen in the films - in films
characters are always on the aggression (in romance, in war, in deception), tit-for-tat like
the following is unheard of: "Since the pro-British and pro-American big landlords and
big bourgeoisie," he had noted years before, "are still using the stick and carrot in dealing
with our Party, the policy of our, Party is to 'do unto them as they do unto us,' stick for
stick and carrot for carrot" (Leites, 1970, 51).
8. Relation to Chinese Society
Does any of this relate to the earlier and current state of Chinese society? Where are there
possible avenues for future research? There are a few broad areas where analysis films
could broaden understanding of Chinese society as a whole, including social changes,
social mood, and core values.
Early Films
How do the themes in earlier films relate to: Chinese society? There are potentially
different ways of thinking about this. First, one could think about the themes in relation
to the society that produced themo relationships with the Chinese society of the
1930s-1980s. Second, one could think about whether there are any enduring themes that
would suggest consistency over time.».
What is the importance of the older movie themes as they relate to our understanding of
modern China? Older films have themes that may differ widely from modern films, and it
may not be clear how they relate to understanding of modern society. And yet, these films
still shed light on our questions - how has China adapted in the 20th
century, and what
might be the direction of China's rise in the 21st.
Older films reflect the spirit of their period. Examining the themes, characters, and plots
from these films helps modern analysts think about the social, political, and economic
conditions that shaped the founding of the People's Republic. Examining themes over
time helps us to understand whether there was change - whether Chinese viewers were
still grappling with the same issues as the PRC matured. And they help us understand the
psychological mindset of Chinese citizens during the 20th
century, some parts of which
may still persist today. We may expect some of these themes to be enacted throughout the
20th century, resolved (or not), and some may still persist as issues lingering in minds
today. Although certainly some facets will change, some of the core psychological
features that we see in early film themes remain in both modern films and in modern
Chinese society.
By illuminating the past and by showing the beliefs, trials, worries, and victories of the
men and women in early 200
century China, we will be able to better reflect on the same
topics in modern China. Although society is dynamic, people are fundamentally the same
- they have the same motivations, fears, and interactions, and we may aggregate these to
the level of society by examining these themes.
What interested older Chinese filmmakers, and what does that mean for modern China?
Older films were often concerned with social trequality, revolution, colonialism,
authority, sacrifice and duty, social change, the influence of capitalism, and loyalty.

Social Inequality
China was in turmoil in the early 20
th"
: century, with leftist political parties railing against
the influence of landowners and the last vestiges of the imperial government in
suppressing the landless and poor. This was reflected in film, with many films examining
the plight of the poor and their attempts to fight back against landlords and other
oppressive figures.
This climate deeply influenced political parties during the period, with a variety of leftist
parties vying for control over the country in their attempts to right these wrongs
according to their own political ideology. And this great desire to increase the quality of
life of the masses was a key plank of the Communist Party platform, which has persisted
to the present. Even though the CCP has embraced capitalist ideals, it is still bound to
improving quality of life for the broad masses of China's population, and this need has
become more urgent with China's swelling population. In the social and economic
1
climate portrayed in these early films, we can see some of the beginnings of why the
Communist Party behaves the way it does with respect to social welfare programs,
protectionist economic policies, and maintaining its purported ideology while still
embracing capitalism.
Revolution
Revolution was seen as a means for change. Indeed, it was seen as one of the best means
for change, a way to wipe the slate clean and to take total power for the masses. Of
course, the Chinese Civil War enacted the revolution that films called for, and this
revolutionary fervor was repeated throughout the 20th
century (ex: Cultural Revolution).
What these films show is that revolution is not unique to the Communist Party. Although
the Communists were the most successful practitioners of revolution, many other parties
believed this to be the best course of action (including the Nationalists). We should
expect this ideology - the ideology of revolution as a means for change - to remain in
Chinese society to this day, and when we view the martial language that some business
leaders use when approaching internationalization, we can see some influence of
revolutionary thought.
Colonialism
Colonialism and foreign influence acting to the detriment of the interests of the Chinese
people is a key aspect of early films. Foreigners acting in a colonialist fashion colluding
with corrupt Chinese was blamed as a reason for China's poverty and inequality in the
early 20th century.
This idea, like revolution, was formative in the minds of early 20th
century Chinese
political and social leaders. It engendered a deep distrust of outside influence that
persisted throughout the 20
th
century and to today - collaboration with foreigners was
seen as an invitation for collusion, corruption, and the degradation of the Chinese people.
Although modern China now has far more interaction with foreigners, it is important to
note that they are often monitored - foreign businesses entering the Chinese market must
establish a joint-venture for the operation to be legal. Given the persistence of this
thought in the Chinese psyche, it is unlikely that this prejudice will disappear in the 21st
century as China opens up.
Authority
Strong authority was viewed as extremely important for China's stability. China is such a
large country with so many people, and with unruly, violent people, that it needed a
strong and firm hand to guide it. Leftists were not so much concerned with authority
itself, but the type of authority that ruled - they would have preferred a people's
government ruling with a firm hand rather than an imperial government with foreign
influences.
And this has persisted. The turmoil of the 20th
century was, in the view of filmmakers
:
and viewers, dealt with only by a firm party, hand guiding government. The modern
government has taken many steps to increase its authority over the populace, which has
met with some moderate resistance from local citizens. But this resistance is often geared
toward corruption on the part of local officials, which we observe in early film, not the
very idea of strong authority itself. We may see history repeat itself with revolutionary
upheaval leading to a strong national government.
Sacrifice and Duty
Sacrifice is a key idea, and sacrifice as one's duty to a greater cause is a noble idea. The
Chinese are expected to uphold their duty first to family, second to community (both local
and writ large). In accomplishing community acts, they are expected at times to sacrifice
themselves for the good of the collective. Although they are portrayed (always) as doing
so in the films, it is not entirely clear how much this will extent to actual interactions.
Social Change
China in the 20
th
century was a time of incredible social change. China went through
multiple revolutions and experienced a transformation from a feudal empire to a modern
capitalist economy. This brought with it a great deal of social change, and the expectation
of change was a main theme of films in the early part of the 20" century. Chinese films
examined how characters reacted to societal changes, generally taking them in stride but
modifying them to fit Chinese societal characteristics. We see this in modern day film;
Chinese characters carouse in the traditional Chinese way, but red wine has begun to
replace baijiu in dinner parties.
Signs for the future point to Chinese citizens reacting to changes, not entirely assimilating
them, but pragmatically choosing which aspects of societal changes they accept in
bettering China.
Capitalism
Chinese film is ambivalent about capitalism, generally, but the far more negative opinions
about the detrimental effects of capitalism show up in early film. Related to the themes
about landowners and social inequality, Chinese films pointed to capitalism, and
associated greed, as a primary cause of inequality and oppression in early China.
Ordinary Chinese would be seduced by the allure of money or power coming from
capitalist powers and betray their countrymen, violating the fundamental tenets of loyalty
and sacrifice Chinese citizens were expected to uphold.
In the present day, this suspicion toward capitalism persists. Capitalism is practiced with
"Chinese characteristics," with the party not willing to fully embrace capitalist ideals,
attempting instead to remain cautious about China's opening so as to avoid the negative
effects portrayed in early film.
Loyalty
Loyalty is an important factor in decision-making in early Chinese film. Individuals are
expected to be loyal to the collectives to which they are a part - particularly their family,
work groups (danwei), and political organizations. These are key relationships to which
individuals are bound. Loyalty to motherland and to the idea of unified China is
paramount among these collectives.

Modern Films
Social Changes
Some of the themes and characters above point to changes in Chinese society that are
worth considering. Chinese society continues to undergo rapid change, partly due to
globalization. This includes exposure, both economic and personal, to western society.
Scholars debate the extent of these changes and implications such as US-China relations
and the extent to which China is a rising global or partial power (Friedberg, 2011;
Schamburg, 2013).
One can also see manifestation of social changes in Chinese films. Chinese citizens, on
the basis of these films, appear to be taking on some of the habits of the west, but they do
not seem to be accepting core western political values of individual liberty or democracy.
Rather, they accept superficial, quality-of-life improvements that reflect China's new
economic standing. It would be interesting to consider, through survey data or other
sources, the extent to which the reality portrayed in film is the reality for most middle-
class Chinese citizens. What elements of western culture do they actually embrace, and
what elements of Chinese culture do they wish to keep? A changing national culture over
time could lead to changes in decision-making patterns, making this an interesting
exercise from a strategic and business perspective.
Another element of social change is in, acceptance of things that Chinese society may not
have traditionally discussed. Things treated in these films, like suicide, mental handicap,
depression, and homosexuality, could, point to growing social and governmental
acceptance and recognition. This could mean that these issues now have a place in
Chinese society, and that film could be used as a medium to discuss these issues where
other forums are not suitable. Presence of such issues in film could point to their growing
presence in society, although that may be somewhat of a stretch.
Considering social changes could also help. chart the direction of Chinese society in the
future. The areas of change, their scale, and their speed are things of note that could be
the seeds for social revolution in China in the near future. Considering these elements
from film, and then considering government reactions to change, could help to identify
the most likely areas where change will endure.
Social Mood
Following the Leites perspective, one, can also think of films as reflecting a kind of
'social mood' in a culture. Are the people of a country relatively happy with their lives or
fairly upset with their lives? How does this relate to how they perceive their government?
This could be done by identifying areas of film's where characters experience discontent,
whether set in historical or modern times, and trying to relate those sources of discontent
to the modern Chinese experience. Cross-checking with Chinese social media and news
outlets could verify this discontent, however much it is expressed.
In this way, film serves as another way to keep a finger on the pulse of Chinese society.
Understanding what ordinary Chinese citizens think about could be very interesting,
particularly with regard to perceptions of the west.
Core Values
One can also identify certain Chinese core values from films.
The values characters
espouse are those the Chinese government could have identified as being important for
the Chinese people to view. Identifying the values of a society and culture can be
challenging; sources of culture like film, radio, television, and literature are all ways to
see what things those in a culture care about. Because no films are released that the
government has not endorsed, the implication is that the government at the very least
tacitly approves of the values in question.
With respect to the films that the government has sponsored (or has heavily promoted) -
these include Founding of a Republic, Founding of a Party, and Confucius - these films
have some common themes and values. While these values exist in plenty of other films,
they are particularly evident here - they include: sacrifice, loyalty to the state, humility,
love for family, desire for order, close connection to the common people, and love for
China. Absent are any problems innate to China - any problems in these films come
externally. When sadness and distress comes in these films, it comes from external
sources (foreign interlopers), or from distress over inability to properly serve the state and
party. Corruption is not a concern in these films, nor is romance - the characters eschew
any romance for the sake of duty.
A host of questions arises from this sort of analysis - what do the Chinese believe to be
moral? When do they believe that it is right to, step forward or when it is right to back
down? How do they believe confrontations arise,, and how do they end? What do they
think about the natural order of the world and how states and people interact? These are
all core values of Chinese society that; would, be worth knowing for anyone studying
China seriously, and while spending time in China and talking with the Chinese may be a
good way of doing this, viewing films would be a way of doing so with the CCP's stamp
of approval. If the CCP wishes to shape.Chinese society in a way that benefits the regime
and its future, it would be good to understand the core values it wants the Chinese people
to have.
Strategic Mindset
These data demonstrate some changes in Chinese society as a whole, but what about in
terms of decision-making style or operational capabilities? Is it indicative of changes in
Chinese thinking at the government level? Where could one identify areas where lessons
from these films could speak to not just society?
There are several areas where there
could be potential linkages.
There are two major reasons why it may be possible to understand some implications
about government from movies. First, films are consumed not just by the Chinese public,
but by government employees as well. There is no reason to believe they do not affect
them in the same way. Second, films ostensibly promote a government message, which
members of government help craft. The government as a whole should support the
messages they send and some elements of operations should follow them.
There is a class of films that are heavily promoted by the government. These films
are subsidized by the government, they enjoy fast-tracked review, and the government
might even subsidize tickets for Chinese citizens. The three best examples in this sample
are Confucius, The Founding of a Republic, and The Founding of a Party. These films do
not promote uniquely different values from the rest of Chinese film - the message is in
line with what else exists, but there is certainly more emphasis on certain aspects.
Specifically, these films highlight sacrifice, duty, authority, the primacy of China, and
stability as the biggest themes. The message sent is that China suffers from both internal
and external threats, and that all Chinese, are duty-bound to sacrifice what they can to
support stability through the authority of the Communist Party.
Government as family
Portrayal of the Chinese government in relation to society is paternalistic (or
maternalistic). In particular, the Chinese military is almost always shown as taking great
care of the people and making sacrifices to ensure the people's safety and comfort. For
example, in A Railway in the Clouds, a PLA engineering unit undergoes great hardship in
building a railway to Tibet. Soldiers suffer, die, but ultimately prevail in their desire to
serve the people. Other government entities are also shown as being effective at their
jobs, but also caring about the people as well.
A more cynical perspective would say this is pure propaganda, that the ideology
expressed is only for the benefit of the average Chinese and not indicative of the true
feelings of the Chinese military or government. But the government draws much of its
legitimacy from its ability to provide for the people, and it stands to reason there could be
significant elements within the military and government who believe genuinely that their
role is to safeguard the well-being of the people at all costs.
Propaganda is effective if the people believe it "- if the Chinese people buy into this
concept of a paternalistic government, government as family, there could be significant
loyalty to the government under most circumstances. In film, families are portrayed as
unbreakable, with bonds lasting even after death. Civilian loyalty to the government as a
whole would then be high, and civilians would be willing to overlook some government
transgressions in favor of the bigger picture ..
General antipathy toward foreigners (or ambivalence)
Another area where there could be a linkage is in general government feelings toward
foreigners. Both as individual government workers and as a collective whole, it is
possible the government harbors distrust of foreigners - this is the message they repeat in
film. There is general antipathy toward foreigners or the idea of Chinese moving abroad
or interacting with them.
Doctrine
Could Chinese military doctrine change as its society changes? The PLA has relied on the
people's war concept in the past, and edited volumes have considered how China could
think about the future security. environment: According to Pillsbury, "China's military
authors have called the future multipolar world :"amazingly" similar to the Warring States
era and declare that China's future security environment resembles the Warring States era
in several ways" (Pillsbury, 2000, xxxvi). Chinese strategists seem to draw from Sun Tzu
and his contemporaries when thinking about security issues. However, Pillsbury also
reports that the people's war concept has begun to be supplanted by the "Local War"
school of thought, which argues that China's next war will be limited, will not be a war of
survival requiring the people, and will be quick (Pillsbury, 2000, 262). And there is also
an RMA school of thought that sees war scenarios with Japan or the United States -
networked warfare in high-tech environments (Pillsbury, 2000, 265). As films have
described a changing China, some of this (the networked aspects) might be expressed in
the concept of people's war.
Chinese films depict a network, cosmopolitan society that has adopted many western
habits and thinking - how does this relate to the military? If young people entering the
military bring with them this new way of thinking, perhaps the military itself will adapt to
take advantage of all the benefits (and weaknesses) that creates. This would imply a
networked military, quick to adopt new technology, but prone to overcommunication and
deception within the ranks. It also implies a military that is undergoing significant flux
about the role of duty in relation to family -" to whom does the military answer, the
people or the Party? Ordinary Chinese ask themselves this in relation to their professional
and family lives, perhaps similar grappling goes on in the military. So far, it seems loyalty
to the family wins out.
However, one of the biggest themes in Chinese film is also the relative lack of trust
among members of Chinese society - characters in films cannot bring themselves to trust
each other, and there are numerous examples of scammers stealing money, property, or
just seeking to profit from someone else's misfortune. Ordinary Chinese citizens are often
depicted as rapacious (when it comes to money) - and social cohesion is not a big theme
in film. That is to say, in Chinese film it is rare to see communities banding together to
fight off an enemy or to solve a problem; they wait for an authority to solve it for them.
This lack of trust extends to leadership feelings (in the films), particularly toward
foreigners. This could have several effects on military doctrine; an underlying feeling of
mistrust in a society - and leadership concurrence with that feeling - could result in a
country that views the outside world with distrust as well, potentially making China more
hostile. But yet, a lack of trust among Chinese - therefore extending to the level of the
military unit - may affect how Chinese commanders view their forces.
Resiliency
One of the biggest recurring themes in film is that China is a resilient country full of
resilient people; there are no challenges China cannot overcome, whether those be
internal, external, or natural. This has been instilled in the Chinese way of thinking -
even Mao thought it was possible for China to win a nuclear war simply because of
population.
This could mean the Chinese are less risk-averse than the west. In the US, it is national
news when a single US soldier dies in Afghanistan or Iraq. Would this be the same in
China? Would the Chinese be more willing to accept losses, whether those be financial or
human, in the name of progress? This could play a role in shaping Chinese doctrine and
make Chinese leaders (and the people). more aggressive.
Chain of Command
How could this relate to chain of command in Chinese government organizations? Chain
of command as portrayed in film, both in military and private realms, is very top-down.
There is little room for individual initiative; one follows the orders of the commanding
officer. This holds true in family life just as much as it does in professional life - Chinese
families follow the directives of the most senior,, the father, grandfather, or otherwise.
This could lead to Chinese organizations being prone to conservative thinking and
relative lack of innovation. An organization that is bottom-down to the point of not
entertaining courses outside of what the leader says has significant vulnerabilities. It is
personality-driven, does not have consistent decision-making patterns, and is slow to
come up with new ideas.
9. Closing
Study of a nation's films can help to shed light on underlying patterns of thought,
relationship types, and fears. Nation is used not to describe a political unit, but a social
unit - a nation can transcend state boundaries - the study here depicts some elements of
the Chinese nation as it exists both in the state of China and abroad. China's ex-patriate
community is tightly linked to the mainland, through both official ties and unofficial;
foreign Chinese remittances and visits to the mainland keep the groups close. Ex-patriate
Chinese watch films just like native Chinese, so viewing film could be helpful in better
understanding both groups.
Chinese film subjects have evolved in the century. From a cinema dominated by state-
controlled films about Communist propaganda, Chinese film has blossomed into dozens
of sub-genres, with a heavy prevalence of romantic comedy films and historical epics.
And yet some enduring themes remain in Chinese film - films emphasize sacrifice,
togetherness, and family. Emerging themes tackle some of the challenges facing Chinese
society - social issue, loneliness, care for the elderly or sick.
The approach taken in this report, with an emphasis on a psycho-cultural approach to film
like in the work of Leites and Wolfenstein, shows that a researcher might be able to glean
understanding of a broader nation from representation of visual culture - a finding
supported by the sociology, anthropology, and psychology literature.
While this study has identified some key themes, characters, relationships, and plots in
Chinese film, there is much room for further analysis. One area where work might be
useful is in reconciling the focus on community and the apparent lack of empathy in
modern China. The most famous example of the Chinese lack of empathy came earlier in
2011, when a 2-year old girl in Foshan was struck by two vans and subsequently ignored
by 18 passerby (caught on security tape). She was later taken to a hospital and passed
away from her injuries several days later. The reluctance of ordinary Chinese to help each
other, as well as the predilection for transactional, rather than emotional, relationships (cf.
guanxi practices) is hard to distinguish in most film.
If a lack of empathy really does exist, this would mean that Chinese films are still meant
to be educational - promoting values the government thinks the Chinese people need to
improve. If we accept characters in these films are Platonic ideals (in both positive and
negative senses), we can see what kind of "harmonious society" elements of the Party
might want.

11. Introduction to the Summaries
This appendix of Chinese film draws from the viewing of (so far) 121 films produced
between 1934 and 2012. These films were produced in mainland China, Hong Kong,
Taiwan, or a joint production between some mix of the three. China's film industry has
expanded since its economic opening, and co-productions are now the norm - in
2012-2013, a Chinese studio even collaborated with American studio Marvel in the
production of Iron Man 3. The mainland's' appetite for film has grown as well, although
the majority of ticket receipts still comes from foreign productions, typically American
action films. Regardless, the number of films in part produced by and released on the
mainland has grown to hundreds a year.
These summaries describe the films and highlight some interesting aspects of characters,
relationships, plots, or themes that might relate to the foundational work in the
psychology of film conducted by Martha Wolfenstein and Nathan Leites in their book
Movies: A Psychological Study.
Apart from descriptions of relations with the Wolfenstein and Leites work, the summaries
also describe some elements of the films that may point to uniquely Chinese cinema
characteristics that could speak to national culture or social norms. These elements are
guided by four broad societal generalizations and fall into four categories. For context,
we describe these to introduce the summaries.
> From The
There are three primary genres in these films. First is the historical film - these films look
into China's imperial or feudal period and focus on court intrigue and warfare. Second
are films about the Second World War and Chinese Civil War; these films describe the
Japanese occupation and the conflict with; the KMT. Finally, there are 'modern films' -
this broad category encompasses romantic films and dramas about modern Chinese life.
-
These films are interesting from the perspective of how they might reflect society.
Modern films, owing to the fact that they are set in every day life for many Chinese,
might serve as a 'mirror' on society - they reflect society for all its good and bad. Films
set in the historical period or during the war might show how society ought to be - or at
least how characters ought to behave. More' moralistic stories, they depict 'good'
characters struggling against 'bad,' with. implications for which one the filmmakers
prefer.
Societal Issues
These broad issues reach across all of the 'buckets' into which we might categorize some
of the trends we see in film. These issues serve as a backdrop for character interactions
and frameworks for plots - since they pervade almost every aspect of Chinese film they
are the context for the context.
Ambivalence about capitalism
The transition to full-blown capitalism in Chinese society has been treated with mixed
feelings. While characters are shown as reaping the benefits of capitalism - professional
jobs, experiencing western social rituals (red wine vs. rice wine at dinner), and general
increases in quality of life - they are just as often shown consumed by greed. Greed
causes families and friendships to break upę as characters see opportunities to personally
profit from economic freedom and forsake their past relationships or loyalties in doing so.
Harmonious society
Characters in Chinese films desire a' harmonious society - the term the Chinese
government uses to describe the kind of country it wants when censoring social media.
The harmonious society includes filial piety, respect for others, strong collective action,
adherence to moral standards, and loyalty to one's nation (nation in this sense being used
to describe one's national identity rather than de jure state affiliation). Chinese films vary
in their depictions of the level of harmony in society; historical films looking at China's
past (both imperial era and during the Japanese occupation) show little harmony in
society. There are many examples of the Chinese 'west' - a part of China either in the
past or present that is far from government control and therefore lawless; characters in
many films use the word "chaotic" to describe China in the absence of such a
government. To ensure harmony in a large country whose state of nature is chaos, China
(the implication goes) needs a strong government.
Deception
In many Chinese films, characters relate to each other through deception. This is most
common in films set during China's historical era that focus on court intrigue or grand
strategy as related to warfare. Characters enact incredibly intricate plans to gain the upper
hand over their adversaries and victory goes to the ones who are most clever. In films set
during the modern era, deception occurs within relationships - husbands have mistresses,
boys sneak out to visit girls, etc. In the film's deception is part of the fabric of Chinese
-
life.
What leads to victory?
What leads to victory? What can one call a victory? Chinese films often consider the
meaning of victory and how to achieve it; will deception tactics lead to victory? Or is it
better to confront an opponent directly? Can one 'win' in a relationship? Characters
desire victory; they reference that they want to win, but question how to do it.
Broad Themes
In the context of these societal issues, there are some themes that come out of the
summaries.
Romantic Relationships
A large number of Chinese films are concerned with romantic relationships. Within these
films, a number of topics stand out. Many films are concerned with falling in love -
finding love, falling in love, and sustaining love are primary plots points in many films
[11]. But the big emphasis is on how why one falls in love - what about another person is
attractive [28]? And does that attraction sustain over the long term [55]? Can that change
over time?
In Chinese films, characters marry only once. While they may get divorced (but not
onscreen) or become widowed, they do not remarry after losing someone [41]. They stay
alone. When they do try to find others [19], they are thwarted and end up worse off.
Husbands have hidden mistresses [12]. Relationships are shown as 'normal' - there are
no homosexual couples and no age mismatche with the exception of a homosexual couple
depicted in one film [1] set in New York City and produced by Taiwanese and US studios.
Many couples in films are not married, and there are many examples of dating - these
tend to follow western concepts of dating and include western rituals like dinners or red
wine [39]. Losing a boyfriend or a girlfriend in these films is as painful as losing a
spouse.
Women are dominant in relationships, despite the patriarchal nature of Chinese society.
Men are subservient to women; they are expected to take care of them, they do things for
them, and they visit them when they are ill, and they serve as providers. While women
themselves are not helpless - the strong woman is a character archetype - in some
respects they are dependent on men but still in control.
Finally, one of the biggest plot devices in films about relationships is an emphasis on real
estate [72]. This is an accurate reflection of the state of Chinese society, as when a couple
gets married, the husband (or his family) is expected to provide a home for the couple to
start a family. Many of these films have an emphasis on the couple trying to find a home,
or after acquiring a home, the problems they; have with it. This seems to be an
overwhelming concern for young Chinese couples" - and particularly men as in the event
. ..
they cannot afford to purchase one they are in an unfavorable position.
Parents/Family
Many films consider the relationships between families - particularly those between
parents and children. Family units - the nuclear family - are critical in this sample of
films [47]. Characters structure their lives around the formation and sustainment of these
units, and one's primary loyalty is to his or her family once it is formed. If one is not in a
family, their mission is to create one, first with a spouse and then with children [61].
Marriage is incredibly important.
This means that children tend to listen to their parents' guidance, and when they do not,
they get hurt or fail [44]. And failure is unacceptable in front of the family - for children,
parents accept no excuses for failure; they express not just disappointment, but anger. It is
primarily fathers who express anger - the patriarch of the family still holds authority in
both ancient and modern films [17, 58].
Extended family is also important in these relationships. That is to say, parents do not
lose their own parents upon having children. They still have their own parents giving
advice - visiting, counseling, nagging, they still disobey their parents at their own peril
[72]. Sometimes, children even take care of parents. Parents get offers to live with their
children, or if they stay at hospitals, their children visit them and provide help [93].
The primary interactions shown are between parents and children - there are few
interactions between siblings. There are sometimes depictions of single parents, typically
in the case of their partner dying [58]. In these cases, the surviving partner and children
do their best to honor the memory of the deceased. Children never have to deal with the
effects of mistresses - cheating happens among families with no children. When children
go abroad, their parents lament their loss and rejoice upon reunion [1].
This leads to insularity; families are self-contained units, and while there might be
interactions with the broader community, the family is the primary unit of organization
depicted in Chinese film. There are some depictions of work units or military units - but
these are portrayed as being less important than the family organization [9]
Motherland: Loyalty/Organizational Identification
Characters in Chinese films also display serious regard for loyalty. However, the question
is - loyalty to what? Characters display loyalty to country [10], morals [48], leaders [77],
individuals [46], family [43], company [53], and motherland [10]. Primary loyalty seems
to be to one's family, but overriding loyalty is always to one's motherland. China, as a
nation, holds everybody's loyalty no matter what, and if one's family is standing in the
way of China's prosperity they will be pushed aside [20].
Authority is important in protecting the motherland. Characters continually describe
China as being 'chaotic' without a strong authority to protect it - this is prevalent in films
in the historical era; characters desire a strong leader to unify China and impose order on
a state of nature that is violent and barbaric [69]. Characters in Chinese films seek a
'harmonious society' where all Chinese can prosper. Modern Chinese society may have
ills (as depicted in several films, including economic inequality and aimlessness, 24 and
63), but there are no modern protests. Authority figures are morally upstanding when they
are positive characters - the police, for example, are shown as professional and morally
upstanding [25].
When one rebels against authority, it is because the leaders are corrupt. The 'corrupt
leader' archetype is common; corrupt leaders extract rents from local populations while
providing nothing in return, abuse the people under their rule, and violate moral
principles - what those moral principles precisely are is never specified but generally
follows the principles of doing good for the people, following principles of 'justice,' and
remaining humble [48]. Rebellion fails when its cause is unjust and succeeds when it is
just and the leaders are corrupt [6].
Foreigners aid corrupt leaders in extracting resources and wealth from China - the
'corrupt foreigner' is another character type [64]. Shown as foreign, white military
officers planning to build railroads and to take coal and money out of China. These
foreigners are always shown in league with, a corrupt local leader who stands to
personally gain from collusion. Interestingly in films on the Second World War, films
portray the KMT military in a neutral light - they too were trying to defend China.
However, KMT troops are shown as much worse in quality when compared to CCP
troops - they break and run from combat much more quickly [70].
How does one protect authority and" prove loyalty? Loyalty is proved by sacrifice.
Ordinary Chinese sacrifice themselves on a regular basis - their livelihoods, wealth,
family, and lives - to protect China. And this is not just for loyalty to the Chinese nation;
to prove loyalty to whatever organization a character identifies with (family, company,
etc), a character must sacrifice [59].
In sacrificing, one might have to commit violence. But in committing violence, characters
do not do so in the same style as in Leites and Wolfenstein, where there are crimes of
passion and those motivated by internal violence that the character cannot contain. In
Chinese films, all characters are capable of committing violence, but they are adept at
controlling it. That is, they use violence as a tool like any other for specific reasons. It is
violence with purpose [76].
Self Staging
The Wolfenstein and Leites film describe's how characters in the films they survey follow
the archetypes of "Performers and. Onlookers." These characters are performers or
viewers of performances. In Chinese film; this is rare. There are plenty of examples of
onlookers - voyeurism is as important in Chinese films as they are in American films.
However, there are no actual performances in these films.
When there are performances, they are self-staging. Karaoke is a common and important
aspect of Chinese film [7]. Characters perform for themselves. They perform for one
another but not for pay.
--
These categories do not provide for a comprehensive assessment of films - the range of
films covered is quite vast and reductive categories cannot hope to cover every nuance of
film. Film plots range from dark comedies set in the Chinese desert [35], to films about
families coping with the aftermath of earthquakes [62], to searches for crocodiles [95].
There is no reason to assume that films would be any less wide-ranging in subject matter
than what they try to capture - life itself ....
12. Film Summaries
Modern Films
1. The Wedding Banquet (1993)
The Wedding Banquet is unique among these films for being a joint US-Taiwanese
production. It depicts an elaborate scheme enacted by a gay Taiwanese man living in
New York City, along with one of his tenants and his boyfriend in order to fool his
traditional parents that he has met and plans on marrying an Asian woman. Relationship
dynamics here are complex; while the parents are excited that their son has found a wife
(as his father remarks, "I can finally hold"y"grandson"), they realize he is faking the
marriage. At the same time, the woman enters the sham marriage for a green card, but
actually has feelings for him - playing the Leitesian vamp in seducing him and becoming
pregnant with his child. The parent-child relationships here follow closely some of the
Leitesian descriptions of relationships, particularly close relationships between mother
and son. However, the father's relationship (with all) in this film is the opposite, with a
dominant, prominence in the film.
2. Chungking Express (1994)
Chunking Express is a film with two stories, both about police officers. In the first
story, a cop mulls his breakup with a girlfriend and drug dealer encounter; while in the
second story another cop meets a restaurant worker who helps him get over the loss of a
girlfriend. The film explores how the four main characters relate and portrays them as
often being alone. In particular, the relationship of the character in the second story with
the restaurant worker is a developing love that is similar to the 'lovers and loved ones'
theme from Movies. The nice girl in the restaurant is paired with the seediness of a snack
bar - while not criminal in nature (and no violence or crime is portrayed in the film), she
is clearly a good girl in a very shady environment. She is a form of the 'seducer'
referenced in the Wolfenstein and Leites book - approaching a budding with perhaps
even more confidence than the police character, shown by her attempts at infiltrating his
apartment to try to make his life better,
3. In the Heat of the Sun (1994)
In the Heat of the Sun is titled literally; this film is set during a hot summer in
Beijing during the Cultural Revolution. A coming of age story about a teenage boy whose
parents (and indeed any adults) are out of sight, the film explores themes of loyalty,
courage, delinquency, rebellion, and finding love. The cinematography in the film evokes
the idea of memory; in addition to the heat, the colors are hazy and washed out, as if the
narrator (reflecting back on his time as a teenager in Beijing) was (mis)remembering his
childhood. He is an onlooker and voyeur; the first scene of the film shows him peering in
on a group of girls practicing dancing, and he meets and courts his love interest by first
breaking into her home and hiding under her bed while she changes. Like in the Leites
and Wolfenstein volume description of American films, his parents recede into the
background - what interactions they have with him are intermittent and he does not hold
any lessons from them.
4. Eat Drink Man Woman (1994)
Eat Drink Man Woman is a story about love - love between man and woman and
love between family members. Taking a weekly family dinner as a backdrop, the film
explores how three daughters take very divergent paths in achieving happiness in love,
and how their relationship with their father evolves. The representation of family here is
generational - similar to how Leites noted US films portrayed families as not as
continuous passages through life. Unlike American films, where fathers may have little
influence, in this film the daughter's feel serious duty to the happiness of their father, and
unlike American films where the relationship is positive - the relationship here seems to
be negative for the daughters, as their father stifles their personal growth. And finally, in
this film the emphasis is not on the family that one makes - the relationships the
daughters have serve only as ancillary setpieces to the main portrayal of the family that
one comes from, another difference from American films.
5. Good Men, Good Women (1995)
Good Men, Good Women has been billed in the west as one of the masterpieces
of film of the 1990s. It is a complex depiction of the effect of history on modern day life in
Taiwan; the ramifications of the Second World War clearly resonate in 1990s Taiwan, and
the film shows the downward spiral of a young actress training to play the role of a 1940s
revolutionary in contrast with the spiral of the revolutionary herself. The film is a portrait
of sadness in modern Taiwanese society. Of particular interest are the female characters'
relationships with their male counterparts, as well as the film's implications on love and
duty. In both relationships (both old and modern), the female character is a 'nice girl'
involved in crime (in old revolutionary activity and in modern times drug dealing and
other 'gangster' type activity). Like in the American films Leites surveys the women are
portrayed as being inherently good - but in this film they are portrayed as being
controlled by forces out of their control. They might be the 'good-bad girls' referenced in
American film - where good girls are spiced up with a façade of badness. However, they
are probably closer to the women in British films, who are good girls who become
seduced by dark, destructive men.
6. The Emperor's Shadow (1996)
In this historical film set during the imperial era, themes of loyalty, revenge, and
!
duty are explored. The main character sets into a plot (conceived for years) to take
revenge on an evil emperor. Interestingly, it also focuses on the use of culture and music
to control the masses. As the king tries to unify China (through warfare), he remarks that
to win hearts and minds of the people after unification, it will be necessary to introduce a
new anthem to bring cultural and spiritual unity to accompany political unity. In this way
the king seeks legitimacy as an emperor. The emperor is shown as a killer in the sense of
Leites' descriptions of British films - where he has internal impulses to order mass
killings (or even torturous punishments upon' Gao) that he must try to control, although
with little success.
7. Xiao Wu (1997)
Xiao Wu is a pickpocket working in a dusty Chinese provincial city. He falls in
love with a prostitute and, despite warnings from his friends, family, and the police,
continues to steal to fund spending on his girlfriend. She is, in the Leitesian tradition, a
'good girl' who hides behind a veneer of badness - while a prostitute, she cares for and is
cared for by Xiao Wu. He has an overtly negative relationship with his parents; at one
point, his mother gives a ring he had given her as a gift to Xiao Wu's sister - lying about
where it went. But rather than being portrayed; as in the wrong, his mother is innocent.
While Leites notes that in American films children are innocent, Xiao Wu here is clearly
the source of bad impulses, although he does have a quick emotional break from them
after that final straw. Here, the emphasis ,is actually on the family made instead of the
family came from, like in the American films Leites surveys.
8. Devils on the Doorstep (2000)
This film was shot in black and white and set during the Japanese occupation of
rural China. Banned in China, it portrayed Japanese and Chinese interaction in a more
sympathetic light than most other productions, showing a group of Chinese peasants
harboring a Japanese soldier in a scheme that ultimately leads to their end (although
seemingly because of their own fault). Leites and Wolfenstein describe how in American
films, death is not acknowledged; they write "For the most part those who meet a violent
end are unsympathetic, not objects for identification or regret" (p. 233). Here, there is an
effort to portray the peasants sheltering the Japanese as sympathetic; in trying to do
something morally right, they meet their end, something the Japanese themselves realize.
While there are no funerals like in the films described by Leites and Wolfenstein, death is
not meant to be passing - it is an integral part of the fabric of this film, as it tries to give
meaning to the villagers' deaths.
9. Platform (2000)
This film explores inter-group dynamics in Communist China. Portraying a
theatre troupe, it shows how culture and the arts were used to deliver messages in rural
China. Leites and Wolfenstein demonstrate that in American films, the older generation is
shown in the background and not too active; emotional detachment. Here, particularly
for the female characters, parents are shown as incredibly overprotective - and they
emphasize arranged marriages that serve to ensure stability rather than love. Even when
men and women are shown entering relationships without an arranged marriage, and
their dialogue is stilted; they are shown as having trouble understanding how to relate to
each other without formal structures. This film contains two scenes of the troupe dancing
- one toward the beginning of the film, prior to changing socio-cultural-economic norms,
where the characters dance unnaturally, awkwardly. The second scene, after
modernization, shows the characters dancing in a manner one might expect from the
west.
10. Hero (2002)
Hero deals with themes of sacrifice, the need for authority to quash violence, and
the futility of rebellion. In this film Jet Liystars as an assassin who ultimately abandons
his quest to kill the king after realizing the necessity of uniting China under a common
dynasty. There is a side love story in this film; but since the thrust of the film is in the
story around the Qin king, the filmmakers gave light treatment to the love story. However,
there is a murder/suicide scene toward the end of the film - as one woman realizes her
lover has convinced the assassin not to undertake his mission, she becomes furious and
kills him, then commits suicide - similar to suicides in British films described by Leites
and Wolfenstein.
11. For There to be Love (2001)
This film follows four young people as they volunteer their time in Shenzhen. It
portrays in great detail their efforts to do volunteer work in their town - as well as the
benefits that reaps. Rather than a traditional love story focusing on relationships between
man and woman, this film attempts to show how love among people in general can be a
positive force in society. One of the young women finds a mother figure to help care for -
as a recurring theme in Chinese society is proper care for one's parents, this woman
serves as a sort of surrogate daughter to an elderly woman. Leites and Wolfenstein
describe how (p. 119) in the films they survey, heroines frequently lack mothers, and those
who have mothers are not important or agreeable. The opposite is true in For There to be
Love; rather, there is a strong 'mother daughter relationship with mutual benefit. The
daughter receives wisdom and counsel from the mother (here the old woman gives the
young woman advice on dating), while the older woman still feels loved.
12. Cell Phone (2003)
This comedy film looks at how technology is changing China; the main character
keeps in touch with his mistress on his cell phone. The main character takes pleasure in
skirting rules, not caring for social customs, and doing things for face - he takes cell
phone calls at any time of day no matter who he is with. Leites and Wolfenstein show that
the vamp was a foreign import to American films (p. 33), and in this film it seems the
vamp has been imported to China, as the mistress is a clear vamp. However unlike the
foreign vamps described by Leites, she is not a source of comic relief in the film but more
of a source of pain - her seduction techniques play into the naturally unorthodox social
proclivities of the main character and lead him to his ruin. At the end of the film he
divorces from his wife but loses the mistress as well.
13. Three Times (2005)
This film is shot as three vignettes - one set in 1966, one in 1911, and one in 2005
- three love stories all involving the same two actors. This is a Taiwanese film and it
makes use of regional dialects (Hokkien) in addition to Mandarin. The second short is
actually shot as a silent film, complete with dialogue cards. In general, the film is very
sparse on dialogue, which makes it challenging to complete a Leitesian analysis.
However, one aspect of the film that stands out is that in each short, the female character
is a performer - in the first she is a pool hall attendee, in the second a prostitute, and in
the third a singer. In each short, the man is an onlooker - in some fashion a client of the
woman's services. This is very similar to Leites and Wolfenstein's description of how this
relationship works in French and British films (p. 278). However, there are no depictions
of these women with other men, as there are in the British and French examples. In Three
Times, they work personally and only with the men portrayed in the shorts; there is
therefore no chance of jealousy or triangular relationships - here the filmmaker focuses
solely on the relationships between the performer and client.
14. Sunflower (2005)
Sunflower examines family - how 'families stay together regardless of tragedy
(like the Cultural Revolution and earthquakes ;as, portrayed in the film). Once again films
are shown as transmitting information to the countryside. The family changes
significantly from the 1970s to the 1990s; the change in Chinese society is really striking.
Family plays a crucial role in this film; similar to the Leites and Wolfenstein description
of fathers (p. 110), the father in this film is absent for much of it - ineffectual - because of
his purge during the Cultural Revolution. Upon his returned he is a changed man with a
disability and hopes his son can take up the mantle as an artist. There are some
voyeuristic/onlooker themes here as well, as in a pivotal scene, the father finally realizes
that his son still loves him even after his absence by secretly watching his son cry and be
emotional in a grove of trees. While not exactly the same as the voyeurism surrounding
love in the Leites/Wolfenstein work, there is a strong streak of onlooking in the film
(informers, Cultural Revolution, at one point the main character observes a girl skating
..
at an ice rink, etc).
15. The Silent Holy Stones (2005)
This is a pseudo-documentary film: looking into the effects of modernization,
consumerism, and Westernization on Tibetan culture. Produced by the Chinese
government, it shows a young lama. at, a monastery becoming introduced to, and
ultimately consumed by, television, to the effect of blocking out all of the rich cultural
traditions taking part around him as well as his family. There are several father figures in
this film. Including the lama's biological father, there are the lama's mentors at the
monastery. They all try to appease the lama and shape his development in important and
evident ways (primarily by controlling what he'can and cannot do) - this is in contrast to
the style of parenting described in Leites and Wolfenstein. However, in this film the lama
is disrespectful of those desires and seeks out western pleasures in a manner that is
intended to shame the lama and make the viewer wonder question his filial piety.
16. Crazy Stone (2006)
In only a few respects does this dark comedy about rival groups grappling for a
valuable jade pendant give insight into Chinese society. There are a few superficial
details to note: (1) the film pays homage to numerous other films (including western films
like Mission Impossible); (2) characters in this film recite historical proverbs - such as
Sun Tzu's maxim to "Know thy enemy and know thyself"; and (3) comedy here is
slapstick, similar to Hong Kong martial arts films. Of interest are the relationships
!
between men and women in this film - women are decidedly treated as objects. In one
sequence about a cheating wife, it is intimated that women are not capable of cheating
themselves - they are not clever enough - but that evil men around them trick them.
Instead of them cheating with other men, it is those men who cheat them by tricking them.
17. Curse of the Golden Flower (2006)
This film portrays deception schemes among the Chinese imperial family. The
emperor, who has recently returned with one of his generals (a son), returns to his wife,
stepson, and court. There is a concealed triangle here as the empress is having an illicit
affair with her stepson. This is in line with the descriptions of concealed triangles in the
Leites and Wolfenstein study. In this film, the concealed triangle is use as a means of
spurring rebellion; the empress uses her influence in the triangle to force her stepson to
lead a doomed rebellion against his father (her husband), which fails. He commits
suicide rather than cede to his father's punishment, which is to feed his former lover
poison daily until she dies. Finally, with respect, to the theme of authoritarianism - the
film could easily be read as a message that authoritarianism always triumphs over
rebellion, as the emperor's forces easily defeat the rebellion (as the emperor is a superior
practitioner of deception methods). However, there is also the idea that too much
authority can turn subjects brittle and make them snap; while the emperor has won, his
sons all died, he has no heir, and the future stability of his empire is unclear.
18. A Battle of Wits (2006)
This showcases the Chinese appreciation of deception; this film is about conflict
during the Warring States Era and how deception and trickery won the day (often) over
brute force. The main character is a stalwart example of Chinese manhood - calm and
collected, never tempted by women, and ready to loyally see through the task at hand
competently. There is a seducer in the film - a woman who admires Ge Li, the Mohist
fighter who aids the city-states against invading armies, but he is resolute and shakes off
the temptation to focus on fighting. With respect to material Leites and Wolfenstein would
have found interesting, this film contains relatively little as it is action-oriented.
19. The Postmodern Life of My Aunt (2006)
This film examines loneliness, aging, and loss as an experience for the elderly.
Chinese society has changed so quickly that many elderly may feel left behind; in this film
the main character is an old woman trying to adjust to family life and relationships in
new China - she is unsuccessful. The primary source of tension in this film is the woman's
attempt to find new love; feeling lonely, she meets a man at a park and engages in a brief
courtship. Unlike in the American films Leites and Wolfenstein describe (p. 47), here the
woman can clearly love twice and quickly falls in love with the man. Offering a promise
of easy and quick return on investment if she would just give him her life savings, she
ends up losing it all when he turns out to be a scammer.
20. The Legend of the Black Scorpion (2006)
The Legend of the Black Scorpion is a story about deception set in imperial
China. In this film, again we see scheming among an imperial family - involving the
poison of a black scorpion - for power and to take down the throne. This film and others
in the genre are based on Chinese historical epics. The film opens with a concealed
triangle; the emperor takes as his wife a woman whom his son loves. The Empress
(Dowager)'s machinations lead her to the'tithrone - by assassinating the Emperor.
However, in a twist, at the end of the film she finds herself assassinated, with the viewer
left unclear about the identity of the assassin. This film has a very similar plot to Curse of
the Golden Flower.
21. Assembly (2007)
This commercial success was one of the first films to consider the Chinese Civil
War - outside of propaganda. It shows the Huaihai campaign and deals with the major
themes of sacrifice and duty; it does not make a political commentary on the validity of
KMT ideology, but focuses on the experiences of individual soldiers. The film, unlike
American films described by Leites that diminish the importance of death, emphasizes
death - in long action sequences soldier and soldier are killed, and not only are their
deaths shown in great detail, but their effects of their deaths on family and friends as
well. Since this was an action movie that focused on large setpieces rather than personal
interactions, relationship dynamics are in general difficult to observe.
22. The Warlords (2007)
This historical film is set during the warring states era. It considers battling and
rivalry among warlords, who are personalities singularly are less important, but when
taken together represent the chaos and destruction in China prior to unification. In this
film brotherhood (even not between blood brothers) and submission to authority
(especially of wives to husbands) is important. The peasant army in this film is portrayed
as being of strong moral character; violence to them does not come naturally (as in some
traditions described by Leites), but as a necessity to feed families and people they love.
Violence is a tool to destroy other morally 'unsound things - for example, in this film the
selling of daughters. Relationships are portrayed not as vessels for love, but as means to
test one's loyalty. Women are submissive, and in this film women need to be pursued and
captured for them to fall in love. In Leites and Wolfenstein, there is a section titled "Will
It [Love] Ever Take the Place of Baseball?" (p. 89). This film would suggest not - but
instead of baseball, love would never replace brotherhood and the ties that men
(especially in warfare) form with one another.
23. Lust, Caution (2007)
This is one of the few films in modern China to explore sexual themes - control
and dominance. Striking in this film is the idea of a gift culture; giving gifts to one
another is important to save face and be polite. This film covers patriotic themes - one of
the supporting male actors is shown as a perfect and heroic patriotic young man who can
hold his liquor and is never tempted by women. In the beginning of this film, the women
are shown as vamps - almost as a den of vipers hoping to manipulate and take advantage
of men. Indeed, the central plot of this film istthat a young woman seduces a Japanese
collaborator to set him up in an assassination, plot - at the last moment she warns him
and is executed along with the rest of the group. In a sense she is a classic good-bad girl,
with her sexual willingness satisfying the collaborator but her sweet nature in public
helping him view her as an idealized object.
24. Lost in Beijing (2007)
Lost in Beijing is an example of a film designed to evoke emotions among a
younger generation - it shows how young people in China might feel lost. This film was
banned in China. Without a college degree, those young people are relegated to wage
slavery and little legal or societal help; in this film the main female is character is raped
by her employer and becomes pregnant. The film shows how her boyfriend, her boss, and
herself deal with the situation; she is objectified throughout. In a complex psychological
turn, her employer finds that he likes the idea of having a child, so chooses to (with the
grudging support of her boyfriend) support, her financially (and even payoff her
boyfriend). The Leites and Wolfenstein volume, describes how women might try to take
advantage of men - for example.on page: 37. they describe the home-digger who seeks
marriage. However, when Leites and Wolfenstein describe relationships, they seem to
focus on the idea of love. In this film there is no love - just exploitation.
25. Kidnap (2007)
This film is a detective/crime thriller about a female police detective trying to find
a kidnapping victim. Police are portrayed as being devoted to their jobs, level-headed,
not prone to rash decisions, and with a strong sense of justice. Interestingly, the other
officers she supervises call her "da jie" (big sister) when they ask her things. The heroine
in this film is also a mother - and when her own son is kidnapped she is obviously deeply
concerned but continues to do her job as a professional. Similar to the American films
described in Leites and Wolfenstein, the child's father is missing/distant, and her
relationship with her son is intense feelings and fear of separation just as Leites
describes (p. 135).
26. An Autobiography of a World War II Orphan (2007)
This is a propaganda film (it was produced by a state film studio) about Japanese
activities in China during the Second World War Taking the form of an interview with an
elderly woman orphaned during the war, the film covers Japanese atrocities, lack of
respect or sympathy in Japanese society, and the lack of an official Japanese apology.
This film covered mostly 'factual' details about the Japanese occupation and had little to
do with interpersonal relationships; although the implication is that humans (especially
in warfare) are inherently violent,
27. Ashes of Time (2008)
Ashes of Time is a story about loss, memory, and redefinition of the wuxia genre.
In most martial arts films, heroes are emotionally detached and serve as stoic enforcers
of justice - in this film, they are flawed, emotional characters, who nearly all meet their
ends due to their relationships. In the Leites and Wolfenstein book, there was significant
discussion of violence - here the violence follows American films, where the hero has
motive but is not inherently bad - they have not done anything wrong. However, unlike
American films, there is a great deal of emotion involved in violence, very similar to
British films. Moreover, the way relationships function in this film follows the seducer
paradigm Leites explains; both women and men are seducers, unlike American films
where this paradigm seemed to have gone by the time Wolfenstein and Leites conducted
their analysis.
28. If You are the One (2008)
Many modern Chinese films consider love and what it means - why does one
marry? Who does one marry? How does a marriage last? In this film the main character
suddenly becomes rich and no longer needs: to work; he dates online to find someone to
spend his life (and money) with, finds a woman whom he thinks he is incompatible with
but then realizes would be very compatible. Leites and Wolfenstein describe the 'home-
digger,' an "intensely attractive and emotionally cold girl, suffering from humble
circumstances, who is ready to marry any man who will give her the comforts she
requires" (p. 39). While the heroine here does not seem to come from humble
circumstances, both characters are clearly ready to settle down and to find emotional
comforts; so while Leites and Wolfenstein describe a world in which economic comforts
dominate, in the Chinese world - and in this film - making a home and making a family is
primarily an emotional concern first with financial concerns secondary. And this is
despite the fact that the hero in this film istrich - it seems like even in spit of his wealth
the heroine falls in love with him. Money, falls by the wayside in the face of true love;
whereas in the Leites and Wolfenstein analysis economic concerns are very important.
29. Red Cliff, Part I (2008)
This is the first part to the Red Cliff series, which takes the Romance of the Three
Kingdoms novel from Chinese classical literature and turns it into an action movie. The
film emphasizes loyalty, duty, courage, and deception among the main characters as
primary character traits. Relationships are stylized - the focus is on friendships (and
conflict) between men. There is an example. of the Leitesian 'masculine girl,' as one of the
primary heroines is very skilled at martial arts. The Leites and Wolfenstein descriptions
of 'killers and victims' focus on murders, individual motivations for crime, and human
desires for violence. In Red Cliff, violence is used as Clausewitz envisioned it - as
politics by other means. None of the characters hold grudges against each other or view
their conflict to be personal (despite the fact that their war spans an entire nation).
Rather, they understand that they have differing political viewpoints and serve different
masters, and these facts should not lead them to violence for its own sake, but they should
use violence as a means to exert their political beliefs.
30. Overheard (2009)
Voyeurism - seeing - is the premise of this film. Three police officers comprise the
main characters in this film; assigned to a surveillance detail on insider trading, they
quickly become mixed up in a 'scheme to pump stock prices and profit. They use
voyeurism to spy on stock brokers, each others, criminals, and each others' loved ones -
but in doing so, seem to sacrifice their morality and almost all die; they become
onlookers in the Leitesian sense. A quote on authority rings out - "If you had turned
yourselves in, this would not be a problem." The main mob boss in the film follows the
Leitesian concept of violence - it is not inherent in him ("I am not a natural born
killer"), referenced in French films. Heroes and victims in the film deal with a mix of
impulses but a sort of ironic justice is served: There is not much emphasis on love in this
film, other than a basic treatment that one of the main characters is a providing father for
his sick son.
31. Stubborn Robot/Radish Warrior (2009)
While there is not much discussion about love in this film, the parents and
children theme plays a significant role; In this film, a father loses his entire family and all
of his life savings in a scam - and to wih it all back he tries a scheme to rob his robber.
Unlike the American films Leites surveys, in this film (and in many Chinese films), this
film shows how important family is in Chinese society - they have long term relations (the
son embarks on an alternate scheme ito retrieve the money to stay close to his father),
unlike in American films, and the father has serious influence in this film.
32. A Railway in the Clouds (2009)
This is a film glorifying the efforts of the PLA to construct railways in Tibet. The
PLA is shown as having made repeated expeditions into the wilderness of Tibet to provide
a railway to service the Tibetan population, with heavy loss of life. With sufficient
courage and dedication, the PLA finally succeeded in their most recent attempt -
replicated in this film. Unlike in the American films Leites describes where parents do not
play a large role, the legacy of the hero's father dying in constructing a similar project
weighs heavily on his mind. But like the Leitesian analysis, the father figure is no longer
around. Even when the hero's mother dies in his hometown, he does not return for the
sake of the project - he apologizes to his mother saying "I am sorry I cannot fulfill
loyalty and filial piety at the same time." While his relationship with his parents may
have been important in the past (and their, legacy is clearly important), his current work
is of greater importance.
33. A Place of One's Own (2009)
This is another film about aimlessness in Chinese society; drug use, lack of steady
employment, evictions, and a continued quest to find a place to put down roots. This film
is set in Taiwan but the manner in which the main characters relate is representative of
mainland film. The characters all have overwhelmingly negative relationships with each
other. Interestingly, there is no sign of government presence in this film like there is in
other mainland films. In this film the heroine is highly capable; her boyfriend and the
others in his band are decadent, lazy, and seem to be directionless. Leites and Wolfenstein
describe love in American films are being flexible; in this one it is. The talented singer
eventually leaves her boyfriend as it becomes evident he is going nowhere. There are two
side-stories to this that follow in parallel (with the three stories converging somewhat
toward the end of the film); in both there are traditional familial relationships shown.
While at first glance the primary focus of this film is a preoccupation with housing, it
becomes apparent that the actual focus of this film is how housing affects relationships;
relationships are changed by possessing or not possessing an apartment with serious
effect.
34. The Founding of a Republic (2009)
This film was sponsored by the Chinese government to commemorate the founding
of the PRC. Looking at the military and political machinations necessary for the CCP to
prevail over the Nationalists, this film puits a positive and heroic spin on Communist
actions. Characters are drawn from 'real-life personages and Mao in particular is
portrayed as a loyal and courageous. ledder. In Red Cliff, the leaders are portrayed as
desiring to gain (politically and militarily) but having no personal innate evil that drives
it. In this film, Chiang Kai Shek actively plans for conflict and violence (the implication
being he loves it) while Mao Zedong is portrayed as willing to compromise; even KMT
troops are shown beating crowds of peaceful celebrants in their quest to subdue the
Chinese people. Contrasts between the two men are evident - where Mao speaks from the
heart, Chiang speaks rigidly from notes. Where Mao spends time with his men and the
peasants they protect, Chiang remains cloistered with his senior advisers in a compound.
Mao's willingness to get close with the people overcomes Chiang's formality and
ceremony. Mao in essence serves as a father, figure for the PLA - and since there are no
other real relationships shown, we might view this as the primary relationship in the film,
one that stands in contrast to the.Leitesian tradition of American films where the parents
do not have an impact. Mao, as father of the country, has an incredible impact on the
lives of those in his extended family not just as a titular leader but as a personal and
moral one as well.
35. A Woman, A Gun, and A Noodle Shop (2009)
This surreal film is one of the more inventive to come out in China in recent years.
It has to do with family relationships in a remote part of rural China in the past; themes
of betrayal, love, friendship, and greed are explored, with the characters conniving to
manipulate each other for personal benefit. There is a strong woman in this film who runs
a noodle shop in the desert; she is sleeping with one of the noodle shop's employees and
scheming against her husband. The heroine fits the character type Leites and Wolfenstein
describe as the 'bad girl,' one who uses men to her advantage and one for whom love is
less important than money. She is not a 'good-bad girl,' with redeemable qualities or one
who turns out not to be actually bad, but she is clearly one willing to use others to get her
way.
36. City of Life and Death (2009).
City of Life and Death is about the Rape of Nanking, an episode in 1937 where
Imperial Japanese Army soldiers pillaged and raped Nanking after Chinese troops
withdrew from the city. Portraying the Japanese as savage and ordinary Chinese as
highly sympathetic toward each other's plight (the climax of the film involves a prostitute
sacrificing her own life), the film highlights common bonds among Chinese. There is less
emphasis on individual relationships, as most of these characters neither knew one
another well nor were in good position to make a relationship during a time of war. The
emphasis is on collective action - soldiers standing up against the Japanese together, or
soldiers willing to die for China together, or groups of people banding together to protect
each other. If the morality of a group is right, collective action can lead to heroic things
and great accomplishments; if the morality of a group is wrong, collective action will
lead to rape and pillaging - in this case the example Japanese soldiers set.
37. The Message (2009)
This is another film set during the Second World War and the Japanese
occupation of China. A film about deception and intelligence work, it glorifies resistance
work during the occupation, how clever both sides (resistance and occupiers) behaved,
and honor in not giving up one's secrets. Characters are lauded (or portrayed favorably)
for remaining loyal to a greater cause and for sacrificing themselves (or others) when
necessary. Because so much of this film, has to do with secrecy and the Chinese
resistance, there is relatively little emphasis on relations. In a sense, their bodies/genders
are less important than their minds. "Is something worth more than your life?" The
answer the film gives is yes - when it is a message that deals with a cause bigger than
ones self.
38. Red Cliff, Part II (2009)
This is the conclusion to the Red Cliff series and follows the same themes/trend as
the first film.
39. Sophie's Revenge (2009)
This film was produced in conjunction with a South Korean studio, another
example that the Chinese industry has opened up in recent years. It is a romantic comedy
- they have become incredibly popular - and deals with standard themes in Chinese
romantic films: the meaning of marriage, the role of women in society, companionship,
loneliness. In this film, the relationship between the man and woman is female
dominated! Love is the primary interest; Sophie narrates "Women have to find their inner
self to find true love ... a man is afraid to enter the wrong career, a woman is afraid to
marry the wrong man." In this film nice guys actually get the girl (in contrast to the
tradition in the west). The portrayal of Sophie in the film is reminiscent of Leites and
Wolfenstein's descriptions of vamps (p. 33) in their volume. She would be closer to a
'good-bad girl,' however, as she is not actually bad but only seems that way (she is an
author and the book she is writing is drawings of revenge against her ex-fiance; she is
portrayed as having justifiable concerns).
40. Bodyguards and Assassins (2009)
This historical film turns Sun Yat Sen's visit to Hong Kong in 1905 into an action
thriller - essentially it pits a grassroots group of bodyguards seeking to guard him
against a group of imperial assassins sent to crush his nascent political movement.
Sacrifice, loyalty, and obedience to correct moral authority (rather than corrupt moral
authority) were the primary themes here, and guided how the characters interacted. The
father-son dynamic in the film is very strong; the hero's father strongly disapproves of
him taking any kind of action to protect Sun Yat Sen in order to protect his business
interests, but he eventually comes around. to
tto the morally 'correct' side, despite the
obvious detriments to his business.
41. Memory of Love (2009)
Memory of Love is a dark psychological thriller. It tells the story of a doctor
whose wife gets into a serious cat accident leaving her with amnesia. Her husband treats
her, but in the process discovers that the reason she was in an accident in the first place
was because she was having an affair. The movie shows how they relate to one another
after the revelation (of which she no longer had knowledge) and how they tried to piece
together their relationship. The idea of a concealed triangle - discussed in Leites and
Wolfenstein - is prevalent in this film for obvious reasons. Of note is that there is utterly
no mention of the older generation in the film; one might think that either the doctor or
wife would like to involve parents in the case of a serious accident, but here the younger
generation is left to deal with the mess they have made on their own - without advice
from those who might know better.
42. The Road Home (2009)
This film takes the theme of filial piety to an extreme. An urban dweller's father,
who was a teacher in a rural school, passeslaway, and he returns to help with the funeral.
Throughout the film, he and his mother grapple with the loss of their father and husband
- demonstrating that in Chinese society these bonds extend beyond death. This film
probably demonstrates the Confucianist family structure to the greatest extent of any
film. This story differs greatly from Leites and Wolfenstein's descriptions of the role of
parents. They note, in relation to the role of the hero's father in film, "[i]n most cases, it
would make no difference to the course of events if the father were eliminated from the
story" (p. 110). In this film, where the whole purpose of the hero's journey home was to
honor his father (and to better understand his mother's grief), this would be impossible.
Moreover, the film tells the story of the love between the hero's father and mother, who
met while the father taught in a quiet village. Like in American films Leites and
Wolfenstein describe, the mother falls in love quickly and then cannot fall in love again -
she cannot love twice.
43. Empire of Silver (2009)
This film explores Chinese economics in the late 1800s, showing how Chinese
bankers adapted to political unrest (the Zuthdi Rebellion), changes to paper money, and
grappling with moral issues when confronted with peasants in need. Ultimately a
morality tale about one's duty to honor 'ancestors by staying true to principles, the film
promotes the rights of peasants in standing against corrupt and greedy forces. Family is
crucial to the film - the patriarch of the' banking clan uses his sons to manage operations
and grooms them to take over. The tension between following rigid regulations and doing
what one might consider more morally right is a big concern for the bankers - the root
problem, of course, being that the laws/rules are in conflict with what is morally sound.
The vision of the father in the film follows that described by Leites and Wolfenstein in the
tradition of American films, where the father suffers from violent tendencies - he is not an
ideal-figure but does what he must (hiring guards to beat protesters etc) to protect his
family and business.
44. Together (2009)
Together is about a father and son remaining together despite the odds being
against them. In this film, the son is a violin prodigy who travels to Beijing with his father
to study under a master. The father wants the best for his son, who sees things slightly
different. The two meet various teachers, including ones who try to take advantage of the
boy, but through their relationship manage to stay together and achieve mutual happiness
(not always through success in music). The father figure in this film is closest to what
Leites and Wolfenstein describe as the French father - an ideal father free from sexual
frustration or aggression. He care's for his son and wants only the very best for him.
Leites and Wolfenstein describe how the son may not be as good of a person as the
father; in this film that is true but only because he is young and learning - while he strays
from his father at times, he ultimately comes back and realizes how his father only wants
the best.
45. Accident (2009)
Accident is a standard action movie about a crew of hitmen who specialize in
making deaths look like accidents - veiling, their actions in deception to avoid discovery
by the police (or having their clients discovered). Violence in this film is not something
taken lightly; the way the assassins operate is portrayed as precise and surgical; they
only do as much harm as they need to do so as to make the operation go off without a
hitch. Leites and Wolfenstein describe how in many of the films they surveyed, men kill
because of frustration in love. But more generally, they discuss how American men kill
because they have something to gain and British men kill because of something they have
lost - in how they work for pay, the hitmen' group in Accident are clearly in the first
category. .
46. Crazy Racer (2009)
Crazy Racer is a dark comedy film about a disgraced bicyclist who was
wrongfully accused of doping. After being stripped of his medals, he stumbles across an
opportunity to take revenge on the man who duped him and his mentor. The themes of
loyalty, revenge, and deception permeate the characters' relationships. In particular, the
hero feels strongly for his former coach, who ultimately died in disgrace because of false
accusations. As a father figure, the coach was violent (like American fathers described by
Leites and Wolfenstein), but clearly held the racer's respect. Leites and Wolfenstein
describe (p. 123) how neuroses may be caused by overindulgent parents; here, the racer's
neuroses seem to be caused in part by the coach's Spartan training regimens and utter
lack of emotional empathy (prior to his death).
47. Shanghai (2010)
Shanghai is a spy film set in Shanghai in October 1941, prior to the official
Japanese declaration of the Pacific War. This, film examines espionage and stars John
Cusack in a leading role as an American naval intelligence officer (his voiced is dubbed
in Chinese, along with all the rest of the cast, who apparently acted in English). This
production was filmed in Bangkok after the plot involving opium and prostitution was
frowned upon by local Chinese authorities; however, China was the first country in which
this film was screened, and it has never been released in the United States. Cusack's
character arrives in Shanghai to investigate the death of his friend and partner, another
American agent. Through a complex web of deception, he finds that his friend seduced
the mistress of a Japanese naval intelligence officer, stumbled upon the Pearl Harbor
plot, and Cusack's character races (to no avail) to get the information to the United
States before the attack. The common spy film themes of Japanese corruption/aggression,
foreign indifference (at one point the slain American officer remarks in a flashback to "do
whatever's necessary, and if our superiors don't know, so be it"), and deception schemes
revolving around espionage. In reference to Leitesian themes in the film, while violence is
portrayed as necessary (not coming from within and directed by certain needs), similar to
some of the films in W+L's sample, the director here portrays the Japanese are possessing
internal bloodlust that colors their actions. They are repeatedly shown attacking and
abusing (committing violence) in the most brutal ways; in one scene, they choose to
behead a resistance collaborator instead of any other means of death. While there are
some depictions of love - the Japanese officen's love for his mistress drives the plot - it is
merely a backdrop and there is not enough substance in the depiction to comment on
relevance to W+L's themes.
48. Echoes of the Rainbow (2010):
-
This film is one of the few Chinese films that depict relationships between siblings.
While there are films about the historical era where sibling relationships are relevant,
these often show discord between siblings - they fight with one another for control of the
throne or country. This film shows the relationship between an elementary-school age
child and his older brother that grows stronger as the older brother falls sick with
leukemia and eventually dies. The father in this film is overbearing, hardworking, and
has incredibly high expectations for both of his sons. The Leites and Wolfenstein study
focuses on twins (p. 140), but when they describe how "the more obscure brother is less
confident and adept when thrown into his, double's position" (p. 142), the same is true in
this film - both brothers are students, and the younger brother is far less accomplished
than the older. But unlike how Leites and Wolfenstein go on to describe, they have no
conflict. There is no rivalry or guilt in how the two relate in this film; they appear to have
only love for one another - possibly more love than that their parents feel for them.
49. Confucius (2010)
This is a biopic of Confucius, covering the latter half of his life when he became
elevated to Minister of Law in the Lu court and then his self-imposed exile as an itinerant
scholar. There are no romantic relationships shown here, nor are there any real scenes of
violence, nor are these really any scenes of family shown. This makes this film in large
part unrelatable to Leites and Wolfenstein's study. The film describes broad themes of
loyalty, filial piety, conviction to strong principles, and humility - Confucius is repeatedly
shown in the film as a humble figure unwilling to accept honor and only desiring an
opportunity to teach his philosophy to leaders to that they may better the people. A
recurring strand in the film is the idea that China is a 'messy' and violent place, with a
need for principles like Confucius' to stay together.
50. Wind Blast (2010)
This film is about violence and how it affects individuals. The film revolves around
what Leites would call killers and victims - with the opening scene of the film a down-on-
his-luck small time criminal conducting an assassination in Hong Kong, and then
becoming pursued into the Gobi Desert by a team of assassins and a team of police. The
film follows the British approach (according to Leites) of depicting violence - the
authorities ultimately prevail, violence is at the center of the film, it focuses on the violent
impulses of man (with a "masculine-girl" in the Leitesian tradition serving as an
archtype assassin), and many of the 'bad' characters end up feeling guilty by the end of
the film. As Leites notes, women can use physical force and men can become their pawns
- in this film, the female assassin tries but ultimately fails - stopped by her mentor, a
man.
51. Lost on Journey (2010)
Lost on Journey is a slapstick comedy chronicling the travels of a wealthy CEO
and a milk farm worker (with many references to the melamine scandal). With respect to
character relationships, there are few examples of male-female relationships - with the
exception of the businessman breaking up with his mistress after becoming transformed
by the journey from a cold-blooded profit-monger to someone who cares about people. It
is a moralistic tale - when the pair find a beggar whom the businessman thinks is a
scammer, the farm worker (supposed to be academically idiotic but with a heart of gold),
remarks "I believe people should help each other ... You are so wealthy, you should help
her." Onlooking/viewing is a major part of this film. The businessman and the worker
watch each other get into trouble and only on the cusp of disaster do they end up helping
each other; in one scene, the businessman must even hide in a woman's hotel room -
whose husband believes she is having an affair - and is mistaken for the woman's lover
when he finds it hard to explain that he merely entered the wrong room.
52. Hot Summer Days (2010)
Several love stories interweave in this complex narrative. A lighthearted romantic
comedy, false appearances play a major role. The primary couple conduct the majority of
their courting via SMS messaging, lying to each other about their profession, but
ultimately upon meeting, realize they have known each other all along. In this film, unlike
in Leiteisan analysis, there are no good-bad girls; all girls are good. There are no vamps
or seducers, the women are portrayed as incredibly sweet and innocent. They are also
portrayed as feminine; no masculine-feminine women either. However, in this film also
there are few connections with these characters" families - in the love stories told here,
the emphasis is on the family made, not on the family from which the characters came.
53. Driverless (2010)
This film also has a number of stories that weave together. The film opens in
media res, showing a major car accident, and the rest of the film shows how the seven
characters arrived at the accident and what they did after. There are three major
relationships here - one between two businesspeople (who used to be lovers in university
ten years prior), one between a deaflmute and a taxi driver (with the innocent, lonely girl
voyeuristically spying on the taxi driver in a manner reminiscent of Leites' onlookers),
and a chauffeur and a wealthy businesswoman - where the relationship comes not from
love but from respect. The voyeuristic young girl is an interesting character, taking
photos of characters to express herself. In this film, the director seems to set out to
understand the meaning of love in a changed China - by what standard does one
measure love? What are the things one might do for love? And how/why might one find
love, and in a relationship, what does one look for? These themes are consistent with
some of the themes expressed by Leites but seem to take the further.
54. Go LaLa Go! (2010)
This romantic comedy explores the balance between work and relationships in
professional China. A secretary (LaLa) starts at a US multinational in Beijing, eventually
working her way up the corporate ladder and forming a relationship with the company's
sales director along the way. There is a major love triangle (similar to what Leites
references) in the form of the sales director, Lala, and the HR director, with whom the
sales director had a prior relationship" and who promoted Lala to her role as his
secretary. There is also a great deal on 'önlooking' in this film - but in this film onlooking
leads to love instead of impeding it.
55. Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen (2010)
This film is set in 1925 China and is a fairly standard film about the beginning of
Japanese occupation. Overwhelmingly, this'film is about the dangers of foreign conquest
- repeatedly in the film Chinese and China are abused by foreign forces. It is one of the
.....
only films to mention Chinese involvement andthe First World War, and Chinese anger at
not having been rewarded by the allies for their war contribution. This film emulates
those films in the Leites and Wolfensteinstudy; it is set in 1920s Shanghai and features
aspects of that era's culture - nightclubs, gambling, smoking, tuxedos, and vamps. The
"Kiki" character in this film is a good: example of the vamp, and in the Leitesian
categories this would align closely with an American film.
56. If You are the One 2 (2010)
This is the continuation of If You are the One, showing the couple from the first
film in their married life. Continuing to explore the theme of the point of marriage, they
are shown as having significant trouble adjusting to their new lives - the wife even
attempts suicide. Ultimately the viewers' conceptions about love, engendered by the first
film, are confirmed by the success of the relationship. But in confirming that success, the
film poses the question - can love have an expiration date? Does a couple's love for one
another change over time? Is there such a thing as aesthetic fatigue? Is it worth it to stay
together when the spark in a relationship is gone? In this sense this film seems to differ
from many of the Leitesian films by asking deeper questions about the meaning of love -
accepting that there are no universals - and giving both characters agency in the process
of discovering it.
57. Triple Tap (2010)
Triple Tap is a police procedural film - an incredibly complex psychological
thriller with multiple plot layers that are somewhat satisfactorily wrapped up in the end.
Similar in structure and procedure to western crime thrillers, of interest here are the
relationships between characters of authority and their subordinates, motivations behind
criminal acts, appropriate times to bend laws and times to follow them to the letter, and
differences of the Hong Kong judicial system to the mainland. In this film, the (anti) hero
organizes a robbery with the help of a bank manager, whom he kills. He kills for the same
reasons as killers in British films - he has latent violent impulses stemming from
professional failures and takes them out in" competitive shooting - which leads to the
robbery attempt. A final note about the film is his relationship with his supervisor, who
has protected his failures for too long and ultimately must turn against him as his lies
unravel.
58. Detective Dee: Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010)
In a film dealing with themes of deception, duty, and black magic, this film
portrays magic in a way rarely seen in Chinese film. In this film, a detective originally
prosecuted for treason is brought back to the Court by Empress Wu Zetian to investigate
a series of murders; his intelligence and morality triumph over forces in the court that
would assassinate Wu and plunge China back into chaos. There are a lot of portrayals of
magic in this film, but few portrayals, of relationships that would be of interest to Leites
and Wolfenstein.
59. Ocean Heaven (2010)
Ocean Heaven examines the plight of China's mentally disabled. In Jet Li's first
dramatic role, he plays a handyman at an aquarium - his wife passed away early and his
son is severely mentally disabled, and Jet Li's character develops terminal cancer. The
film examines not just the rights and options available to the disabled, but also the
relationships between father and son toward the end of life. The father in this film is the
'ideal' father-figure, as Leites and Wolfenstein described for fathers in French films. He is
caring, has no real sexual desires, or anger. There is a romantic interest in the film,
spurred by a promoter of love (as Leites and Wolfenstein) would describe - seeing Jet Li's
character to be lonely in his illness, she introduces him to a woman who
60. Sacrifice (2010)
Sacrifice is an historical film about intrigue in the Chinese imperial court. In this
film, a doctor raises an orphaned child as his own son, preparing him for over 20 years
to take revenge on an evil emperor. The son never learns of his true family background
until the end of the film, when he finally avenges his family. Of course, the doctor
sacrifices himself at the end of the film to give his 'son' a chance at a killing blow. The
portrayal of fathers is similar to how Leites and Wolfenstein describe heroes as fathers;
they exercise a great deal of influence on their sons' lives, and their sons are their
"immortality" (p. 125). The doctor wishes for his adopted son to carry on a legacy that
will last after his death, by eliminating the emperor. Of interest in this film is a triangle -
the emperor, finding that he would like a son as well, tries to teach and sway the doctor's
adopted son over to his 'side.'
61. Let the Bullets Fly (2010)
This is a bandit/heist film set in the Chinese 'west' in the early 20th
century. This
film pits a corrupt local leader against a bandit group who has come to profit but reduce
local corruption at the same time. There is serious tension between the needs of the elite
and the needs of the people. The rivalry between the two main characters shows they
respect each others' intellect; but that they are committed to using all tools at their
disposal (including deception techniques) to win, Characters in this film kill each other -
attacking the other side for gain - but always for a purpose, they do not kill out of
passion, but economic gain. Love does not factor at all into decisions about violence in
this film - a contrast to many of the films Leites and Wolfenstein surveyed.
62. Break Up Club (2010)
This film mixes technology and love in a portrait of relationships in modern
China. In this film, a number of couples break, up - and through the intervention of the
Internet, documentary film technology, and text messaging, they try to fall back in love
but realize they cannot - for a woman, not settling for an aimless man is important;
complacency does not seem to be good for anybody. What is interesting is that DV
cameras are central parts of this film, and it is unclear whether in reality the Chinese
government would allow a documentary film company to distribute cameras and produce
a film of this nature. The bad girl, who has so much attention in Leites and Wolfenstein's
volume, is not in this film - only good girls. The film contains ample examples of
onlookers and voyeurism as it is oriented around capturing documentary film. Finally,
loyalty in love is a primary concern in this film.
63. Aftershock (2010)
Aftershock tells a story in two parts - one part in 1976 during the Tangshan
Earthquake (showing the devastation and pain) and then another part showing different
members of the same family living apart, not knowing who each other are, and then
coming back together in the face of the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake. It is an incredibly
emotional movie showcasing the importance of family in Chinese culture. Leites and
Wolfenstein describe sibling bonds but not the brother/sister relationship. Here the
relationship is nonexistent for a long time - for most of their lives the brother and sister
live apart. Upon meeting, they realize how similar they are and the bond seems to be
natural. The older generation, referenced in Leites and Wolfenstein, is an integral part of
this story - parent/child bonds are incredibly strong, and while there may be anger, the
lasting family relationship is enough to weather any problems. This includes, in this film,
a mother abandoning her daughter in earthquake rubble to save her son.
64. Buddha Mountain (2010)
Buddha Mountain is about the dimlessness of Chinese youth, and how they relate
to each other and to those of the older generation. While to some extent the young will
always treat the previous generation as out of touch, it seems to be very evident here. The
girl in this film is a bad girl - as described by Leites and Wolfenstein. She typifies
problems the filmmakers feel face Chinese youth - alcoholism, drug abuse, abusive
girlfriends, general aimlessness, lack of options without entry into university, and
loneliness. Leites and Wolfenstein have a quote that is relevant to the youth themes in this
film: " ... that Spring should vanish with the Rose! That Youth's sweet-scented Manuscript
should close!" (p. 48). Thinking about youth, leaving youth, and dealing with the
transition is a major theme of the film.
65. Shaolin (2011)
Shaolin is set in Henan province, where the famous Shaolin temple (and monks)
has stood for hundreds of years. Set during the early republican era in China, the film
mixes the plotlines of scheming among warlords with foreign raiding of China. There are
no portrayals of romantic relationships in the film; the film's primary themes are
repentance and violence - in what circumstances and how might someone repent, and
what drives men to violence? Violence is central to this film, and this follows the British
tradition as described by Leites and Wolfenstein - violence is an internal destructive
force that compels men to act - but it can be controlled with proper guidance. "Through
Martial Zen, he has released his hatred. Martial arts is one way to enlightenment.
Cooking is another
way
„to
enlightenment .... life is an accumulation of
experiences" [1:09:50].
66. A Big Deal (2011)
This film is about trying to get rich in Dubai. In most Chinese films, characters
are in China only - or nearby in Asia. Very rarely do they go abroad (as they do so often
in western films). In this film friendships fall apart because of the influence of capitalism;
greed for money makes the friends who traveled to Dubai together split apart (but then
come back together). This comedy film has few relationships of interest to Leites and
Wolfenstein but expresses concepts of innate human greed.
67. My Own Swordsman (2011)
This film is a darker comedy set in the historical Chinese west that takes a
.-....
:
satirical look at some elements of modern Chinese society. First - some superficial
comments: (1) the film focuses heavily on, real estate speculation, which has become a
huge issue in many Chinese cities; (2) it also considers stock market speculation; and (3)
it considers some in-jokes for the movie industry, including an aging Hong Kong martial
arts star poking fun at himself (and many HK actors) for having terrible Mandarin. Many
of the archtypes from the Chinese imperial epic film exist here: the corrupt official, the
stalwart upholder of moral values, and the trickster. All the women in this film are
incredibly masculine and aggressive - with both love and with violence. Leites noted that
manipulating women only appeared in comedies - and the main character of the film is
just that, a manipulating woman looking out for her success.
68. Love is Not Blind (2011)
This film is about breakups. It shows a number of bad relationships with
significant others finding each other in compromising relationships; it also adds in the
supervisor-employee relationship into the mix. The message (and the way relationships
work in this film) is that love and marriage is built on loyalty and humility - you need to
find someone who will be with you no matter what happens, EVEN if one falls out of love.
The main character of this film is a wedding planner who finds her boyfriend out
shopping with another woman - in recovering from her loss, she finds that she falls in
love with her best friend and coworker. This film explores the themes of what is the
purposes of finding love - what kinds of people should one seek and what might sustain a
relationship? The relationship she has with her boss is similar to a father-daughter
relationship, particularly one that might have been suggested by Leites in how loving he
is.
69. Jump Ashin! (2011)
Jump Ashin! follows a gymnastics prodigy, Ashin, as he grapples with coming of
age while training for a career in gymnastics. Falling into crime with his sidekick, the
film focuses on finding oneself, relationships with close friends, and what it means to be
redeemed. Ultimately a morality tale, and handling issues like drug addiction, the film
ends on an optimistic tone - but with the optimism grounded on principles of discipline
and redemption. The depiction of family in this film is different from depictions in W+L
volume, as their work indicated films played a lesser role in hero development - while
here the parents play an integral role. He also has a relationship with a teacher that
might be considered a father-son relationship, but which is not biological; this
occasionally happens in Chinese film with plots oriented around teachers and students.
This is a Taiwanese film and set in Taiwan.
70. The Lost Bladesman (2011)
This story comes from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms classic, portrayed in
the Red Cliff films. It shows the, general. Guan Yu crossing a five passes and slaying six
generals to return to his liege Liu Bei. It is, a story about duty, honor, and the feeling that
one's life is never really one's own, but in the control of larger forces. There is a strong
underlying theme that China needs strong authoritative leadership to maintain order and
to reduce chaos. Characters repeat the phrase. "this world is ruled by wolves." Cao Cao,
the pious leader in this film trying to sway Guan Yu away from Liu Bei, is shown as a
champion of the working class - with even a scene depicting him working in the fields.
When Guan Yu must slay generals who are in his way from returning to Liu Bei, he does
so because he is forced to; he does not desire violence. And nor do the men who stand in
his way desire violence. Cao Cao becomes horrified at hearing this news and it is
revealed that it was the emperor - corrupt and trying to prove himself - who ordered him
to surrender or be killed. Finally, Guan Yu makes a great show out of remaining humble
and respectful to those he considers his superiors. This is a general theme in the film -
that people are powerless and fatalistic; that their lives are driven by forces out of their
control - one soldier remarks to Guan Yu right before Guan Yu kill him that "My life isn't
in my hands. You're not different."" When' Guan Yu wants to kill the emperor, he is
persuaded not to by Cao Cao, who argues that such an act would "unleash complete
chaos."
71. The Flowers of War (2011)
Christian Bale stars in this film set during the Rape of Nanking. Focusing on two
groups who found themselves in a cathedral during the Japanese invasion, a group of
schoolgirls and a group of prostitutes, the film describes how the groups - mediated by
the mortician Christian Bale plays - protect each other from the Japanese. Ultimately,
the prostitutes decide to sacrifice themselves to protect the girls, with the mortician
playing a key role. Bale's character, an American, is portrayed in a very positive light,
which is somewhat of an aberration for most Chinese film. Here the Japanese soldiers
are portrayed as being driven by base animal instincts; lust for sex and violence. For
them violence comes from within - like in the American films described by W+L - but
they have no desire or ability to change it. The prostitutes toward the end of the film
approach something like that of mothers, and their sacrifice to save the schoolgirls is
consistent with the idea of mothers sacrificing for children.
tion .
72. The Law of Attraction (2011).
Four vignettes: encounter, romance, betrayal, and rebirth. None of the stories are
related, but they all center around love and how it works. In the fourth story, rebirth, the
woman in the relationship is a' former drug addict just released from prison and
estranged from her parents; together with her boyfriend she puts her life back together,
showing that strong love and true love stays close in times of need. The parents in the
vignettes are all absent; similar to how they are portrayed in the W+L work. Children are
left to deal with their problems on their own as adults. The first vignette - encounter -
has significant elements of voyeurism, as the security guard a the airport uses her
position to gather information on the auditor and try to get to know him better. A hidden
triangle in the form of an affair is shown in vignette three; similar to another film with
this same plot, a couple becomes seriously injured but it is revealed that the woman in the
car was having an affair - and that upon discovering this triangle her husband caused
the accident. And they ultimately fall back in love and she spends tie visiting him in the
hospital after his eventual arrest.
73. Cold War (2012)
Cold War is a Hong Kong police procedural film looking at how to root out
corruption within Hong Kong's police department. The film describes a plot to hijack a
police van and kidnap five HK olice; officer's, as well as the responses the department
takes to get them back and to find the perpetrators. The film has several layers of
.
. 1:
meaning - first is the rivalry between two competing deputy police commissioners, one
from the administrative branch and one from the operations side. The administrative
commissioner "wins" the rivalry, gaining kudos and plaudits for his handling of the
investigation (the operations commissioner's son was the ultimate culprit, wanting to
elevate his father into the commissioner role). In this way the signal is that thinking and
planning win out over action, where the operations commissioner used men to
understand the case, the administrative commissioner used thinking and investigative
tactics. The other level of meaning is the remarks toward the UK's handover of Hong
Kong to China; the administrative commissioner seems to represent the new wave of
leadership coming from China, technocrats, logical, rational, and not susceptible to
corruption. The Leitesian themes here fall under the parents and children realm; the son
organized the scheme to elevate his father, but his father, with his loyalty to the force and
to the city, ultimately disowns him and allows him to be shot and taken away - family ties
do not win out here over ties to country and duty.
74. Back to 1942 (2012)
This historical film looks back at the 1942 famine in Henan province, which killed
upwards of 3 million rural peasants. The film follows the movements of one refugee
family and shows their hardships as they try to migrate from Henan to Shaanxi; in a
parallel track, it shows the corruption and: incompetence of the KMT government in
addressing the famine, and suggests that Chiang Kai-Shek's inability to deal with it
caused China to lose face in the world and contributed to China's snubbing at the Cairo
conference. The importance of family ties is evident in this film; the family unit ties the
Chinese people together throughout hardship. One of the underlying theme of the film is
the underlying corruption and violence of humanity - in the worst of times, the film
argues, you see the worst in people. Repeatedly in the film there are examples of
predation, profiteering, prostitution, and outright murder/abuse that stem from the
famine, that has defeated a corrupt government's efforts to defeat it and has led to
anarchy in Henan. In an interesting comment on leadership, at one point Chiang remarks
"Give the order, and my men would leap into action. I had no burdens," describing his
frustrations at working with his staff. In terms of connections to Leites and Wolfenstein,
there are comments to be made about the family unit - parents and lovers are incredibly
important, but here the love if out of fexpediency (in one scene a man and wife get
married to that when the wife sells herself into slavery, her children would have a father),
and actual romance and love takes a backseat.
75. Lost in Thailand (2012)
Lost in Thailand is a follow up to the 2010 film Lost on Journey, which has the
same general plot. An uptight, driven businessman goes on a trip with a clear objective in
mind, but is both waylaid and aided by à naïve, childlike, sidekick who works a lower
class job but serves as a moral compass and helps ground the businessman back to
reality through homespun wisdom. The businessman, through a series of adventures,
learns how to draw wealth and meaning from his relationships and not just through
business. In this film, the plot largely revolves around a businessman traveling in
Thailand to find his boss to sign a contract; themes of loyalty and companionship are
prevalent, as is the soul-searching about what gives meaning to life that one finds in other
Chinese films. In terms of themes from the W+L study, there are few here and this is a
comedy. However, there are a number of references to current Chinese society that might
point to what filmgoers experience in' their daily lives: weibo, massages, travel tour
companies, franchised companies, and a fascination with other Asian countries.
76. Qin Jia Guo Nian (2012)
A lighthearted film about two families. (of a young married couple) meeting for the
Lunar New Year celebration, this film accurately captures the tension among many
families in modern China. Exploring themes like wealth disparity, male/female gender
roles in a relationship, anxiety over housing, long lost loves, and other themes, this is a
rich trove of material about the state of modern Chinese relationships. Parents play a
huge role in relationships, as do houses and fighting over real estate property. Here, in
the terminology used by W+L, the family you make is just as important as the family from
where you come. A side story in this film is the hero's mother finding out what happened
to her first love, and couples are shown as needing to strike fast and jump on
opportunities to love unless they are willing to lose them.
77. The Great Magician (2011)
This film is a quasi-historical about the relationship between magic and politics in
historical China. Set after the Chinese Revolution, different warlords use magic to raise
armies, support or fight the Qing remnant, and fight each other. There is the theme of
foreign collaboration - as the Qing remnant seeks help from the Japanese to be restored.
In this film we see a few character archetypes - including a masculine girl who is very
capable but gets herself into trouble by enticing the wrong man. In this film greed and
loyalty compete against each other as characters maneuver for control of the country but
try to remain loyal to their own morality and to their friends.
78. Stand by Me (2011)
Stand by Me explores relationships among young adults in China - trying to think
through the interplay between work and relationships. In this film, two couples deal with
the everyday challenges of professional life in China. They deal with timidity in the face
of bosses, desire to emigrate for better opportunities, the problem of finding a job that
will lead to a career, and of finding a career that will lead to a stable life. One interesting
scene in this film is a portrayal of a Chinese business meeting, where all 'discussion' was
read from a script instead of it being an open forum. In this film one might see a twist on
the types of misconstrued situations referenced in the W+L book - because all the
characters speak Chinese, there are constant mistakes of hearing and people think
romantic things are happening that are in reality not.
79. Overheard 2 (2011)
This is a police drama involving greedy capitalism and corruption - themes the
government holds dear. A Hong Kong film, the film is about stock manipulation, with the
"bosses" of scheme making fortunes from market manipulation. Interestingly, the main
antagonist is shown as being very caring to his mother - even caring for her in person at
the nursing home. Despite being a 'bad' person by many standards, even he retains filial
piety - although this is not in the tradition referenced by W+L in their volume. This film
also references the idea of greedy capitalists and what might be a love/hate relationship
with capitalism.
80. Underdog Knight (2011)
The main character of this film was a life-saver in the Chinese Navy but was
injured and suffered from a serious brain injury, leaving him mentally incapacitated but
still physically able. He becomes a crime-fighter abiding by the basic characteristics of a
good person: be a good person for the nation, be a man of good taste, be tough, be noble,
and serve the nation. His girlfriend, characteristic of a 'good person,' stayed with him
despite the injury. There is a somewhat ambiguous message about vigilantism in Chinese
society as Lao San operates in a purely unofficial capacity. Violence here serves a
purpose - unlike the violence described in W+L that seems to be motivated by personal
relations or by love, violence in this film is used for the purpose of upholding the public
morality.
81. The Founding of a Party (2011)
Another propaganda film sponsored by the Chinese government (and full of major
Chinese film stars), this film documents the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. A
laudatory piece establishing the moral and political legitimacy of the party, this film did
not appear to do well at the marketplace and the government ended up distributing large
numbers of free tickets. This film demonstrates the government's desire for the Chinese
public-at-large to feel patriotic about their motherland and leaders - this film legitimizes
the Chinese Communist Party by showing the chaos it had to fight against. Here again,
violence is planned as a means of ensuring goals are met. There are few romantic or
familial relationships of the kind W+L. would. consider, although one might take Mao
Zedong as the father of the nation - in this sense, he is a wise, calm, and humble leader
who takes on no airs and seems to care deeply for the common people.
82. 1911 (2011)
This film about loyalty, duty, and sacrifice follows the events of the 1911 Xinhai
Rebellion, in another historical epic about the founding of China. It starred Jackie Chan
and a cast of young, revolutionary firebrands. One interesting quote from this film was
about who might lead a revolution: "Overseas Chinese are the heart of the revolution."
While the revolutionaries take the fight. to the enemy (strong nations are born of
revolution), Sun Yat Sen takes the case to the US State Department to ask for aid - which
was denied. Something else the film references is evolution - "All the strongest countries
were born of revolution"; to succeed, China must not follow the old ways but move
forward into the future. Violence, again, is used as a political tool as a means to remove
the foreigners preying on China; the corrupt foreigners meet to plan for what to do about
China, and they are told "This is the last time you can gather to feast on China." Loyalty
here is both to individuals (leaders) and to the Chinese 'nation' - not the official
government, and it is supported by the fact that the moral cause they follow is superior to
the moral cause of their leaders and government.
83. Dear Enemy (2011)
Dear Enemy addresses the themes of work/life balance for young professional
Chinese. It adds balanced between relationships and family - while a young woman
should find a husband, the idea is that she should not forget her parents and family. In
this film, filial responsibility takes precedence over both business and relationships, as the
main female character drops nearly everything to go home for her father's 60'n birthday.
This is similar to the W+L depiction of father/daughter relationships, when they note
"tender relations with fathers can be more fully elaborated in the case of daughters" (p.
123); there is no devaluing of their relationship whatsoever. With respect to the actual
content in the film - there are strong deception themes with respect to how the heroine's
firm conducts business. They enact plans to acquire (or prevent the acquisition of) a
mining company. And yet, characters lament how business relationships seem to them to
be so much simpler than romantic relationships:
84. Demon 2 (2011)
This is a Hong Kong film about the effects of drug addiction and trafficking on
families; in essence a morality tale about the dangers of drugs and how they destroy
lives. The characters in this film suffer from breakdowns due to drugs - and unlike in the
W+L book where some attribution may be given to their parents (p. 122), here the
attribution is given to the declining global economy combined with weak minds/morals.
While parents still love children in their times of trial (and children still love their parents
despite having drug problems), they by no means coddle them.
85. White Vengeance (2011)
Another historical epic, this film considers court intrigue and politics at the Feast
of the Red Gate. Involving betrayal, authority, and rebellion, the film covers similar
themes to most other wuxia or historical films. This films describes conflict between
brothers who compete for rule of China - here there is sibling rivalry similar to that
described by W+L (p. 143). But unlike in the W+L study, there is little guilt about it. The
themes of loyalty and rebellion come through again, and violence is planned through
deception (a plot at a feast that all the major characters attend).
86. Eternal Moment (2011)
This film might be called innovative jcinema in China - rather than one story,
Eternal Moment shows three short vignettes about love, with each trying to show the
meaning of an eternal moment. The film tries to understand what gives love meaning and
how to keep it; the first story is about finding, love but becoming bored with it, the second
story is about losing love, and the final story is about finding it again. Voyeurism plays a
major role in the first segment; the man (in the relationship) watches the woman through
a telescope. The second story has an example of divorce, which is relatively rare in
Chinese film. Finally, mistresses are in the third vignette - demonstrating that mistresses
may or may not be hidden from the rest of Chinese society. Themes from the W+L book
do not seem to match much of the content in this film despite a match in topic areas.
87. Love for Life (2011)
The AIDS Villages of Henan have rarely been addressed in public, but this film
appears to confront it head on. Portraying a group of AIDS victims who contracted the
disease from a blood merchant, the film shows how two of them find love in the face of
adversity and discrimination. In an ironic twist, the man who sold the blood then turned
around and made his living selling coffins once the government banned blood trading.
The love-hate relationship with capitalism is shown quite clearly as capitalism may have
led to freedom to do things - but freedom to be harmed as well. The hero and heroine in
the film does not fit any of the character types from the W+L book. Generally, the film
sends a moralistic message about capitalism rather than focusing on character
relationships.
88. A Beautiful Life (2011)
In A Beautiful Life, an alcoholic real estate agent in an abusive relationship
meets an off-duty police officer, beginning a film oriented around the theme of rescue.
There are continual scenes of him coming to her rescue and refusing to sleep with her,
and the film portrays loneliness in China. In a bustling society, it is often impossible to
make meaningful connections. The heroine in this film is frustrated with Chinese gender
norms, asking a male "You think women can only climb onto a bed?" rather than
climbing, for example, the corporate ladder. This film shows karaoke as a means of
relaxation and social bonding, as well as police officers as stalwart supporters of the
moral good and doing what is right. The police officer here rescues the heroine on a
number of occasions, supports her in starting a business, and when he uses his official
car to support her in some capacity, he willingly accepts that he must resign. The twist in
this film is that the police officer develop's a memory-loss disorder - the heroine ends up
taking care of him. He remarks, "I didn't think a girl from Hong Kong could be so loyal."
Like other romantic films, this does not have "a, direct relation to the W+L themes but
follows in a similar vein.
89. Don't Go Breaking My Heart (2011)
This film references alcoholism and how it destroys human productivity, as well as
how it affects relationships. A woman meets an alcoholic architect and helps him recover;
at the same time, she is courted by an important businessman from the building across
the street. Voyeurism plays a role in this film (important to W+L), as the businessman
watches the heroine from his office window. Dating is shown in this film, but western style
as couples go out for coffee. Western themes and references pervade this film; when
characters are upset they seek western liquors (Black Label and red wine) and western
meals. The moral lesson is that shallow and materialistic love will lose out to love borne
out of true emotions and caring. The question here (and with other films) is whether any
of this is truly relatable to the average Chinese middle-class person watching. Buying
plane tickets on a whim and drinking copious amounts of red wine might not be possible
for most Chinese.
polic
90. The Sorcerer and the White Snake (2011)
This film deals with magic and demons - interestingly, with reliance on what
appears to be Chinese mythology. In this film good and evil magic do battle, with good
winning in the end. Various characters take the form of demons battling it out with
humans fighting on the side of good. This film could be categorized with other films in the
historical period in thinking about loyalty and duty. The protagonist of this film is a
woman - a demon - dressed in red and a seductress, a "bad girl" in the W+L tradition.
Whereas the paranormal is common in American films, it is rare in Chinese films and it is
portrayed as not being strange or odd; it seems utterly normal to have demon hunters
around. Order is also an important part of this film, as the goal of the demon hunter is to
eliminate demons that might threaten the stability of an otherwise harmonious society.

1
91. Great Wall My Love (2012)
A strong independent professional woman takes a trip to the Great Wall on the
occasion of her father's death. Perhaps most importantly, this film highlights the desire of
many Chinese to return to their "laojid" -' in a nation of migrants, returning to your
hometown is important, and the woman's father wishes her to take him before his death to
find a lost love. Along the way, she is shadowed by a private eye (who also has a lost
love) with whom she falls in love. Another side story this film explores is the tension
between mainland and Taiwan and how people relate. This film clearly demonstrates
filial piety - and the relationship between the heroine and her father closely follows the
warm relationships W+L describe. And how, does one find love? In this film, it is through
shared experiences, which seem to sustain the relationship. The woman in this film drives
the relationship forward (with the private eye) and he does much to take care of her while
they travel.
92. I Do (2012)
A film with a 30 year old professional woman trying to find love, this film
emphasizes western behaviors - drinking Grey Goose at bars, for example. The primary
conflict in this film is between the woman and two men - one who left her and moved to
the United States when they were dating in the past, and a divorcee who she has been
dating. In the end, dedication wins out and she chooses the divorcee over the man who
abandoned her once already. These are theme's not really discussed in the W+L study.
This film is interesting in showing online dating as a legitimate means of meeting people
in China; there is also some discussion of divorce - an acknowledgment that it happens
and seems to be rising. This film also underscores the tension between work and play -
the woman in this film works incredibly hard to the detriment of any relationships in her
life
93. An Inaccurate Memoir (2012)
An Inaccurate Memoir is set in the Chinese west, which is a growing motif in
Chinese film. This movie is about bandits, heists, resisting the Japanese - themes of
ruggedness, masculinity, brotherhood, and trickery shine in this film. The west, when,
portrayed in these films, seems to be lawless and in development - without authority (or
in the face of corrupt authority), the common people rely on themselves. The heroine in
this film is a vamp in the W+L tradition. Ancestor worship is portrayed, with the bandit
group praying to their ancestors to honor them; for a society that in many respects
stamped out organized (or unorganized) religion in the mid-20th century, it is striking to
see it acknowledged in film. Any romantic messages contained in this film are lost in the
revolutionary and independent plot devices.
94. Summer Love (2012)
nemes
Another film with three vignettes, this film is also about love. However, in this case
the vignettes take up a small portion of the film and serve to introduce the three main
characters: one effeminate man obsessed with women (earnest but unsuccessfully so), a
man who can only communicate via' text message, and a man obsessed with powerful
women. They end up on Hainan and try their luck at falling in love; the film is somewhat
of a commentary on modern Chinese society but the content seems too shallow to take
seriously. The character from the first vignette has a younger sister (another example of a
sibling relationship that is hard to find) whom he loves very much. The implication here is
that an aggressive approach is not okay with women - the women these men encounter
are all confident and have no problem being successful on their own; women drive
relationships forward in Chinese film by allowing them to happen - they are the pursued,
not the pursuer.
95. Design of Death (2012)
This film is set in 1940s rural China and includes a number of mystical elements.
With a plague ravaging a rural village; a doctor from the government must travel (in the
Chinese west) to the village. to administer care. While there, he was charged with
dispatching a man who is seemingly impervious to violence. One of the few films set in
the 'modern' era that deals with anything other than reality. This film is another in those
about the Chinese 'west' - that lawless region of China far away from government
control.
96. The Locked Door (2012)
False appearances (in the W+L tradition) play a large role in this film set in
1930s Shanghai. Of particular importance is a scene where the main female character
appears to have been raped by a homeless man, but in reality was assaulted by a group of
young rich men. False appearances ruined her life, and she ends up forming a
relationship with the former homeless man as it is her only recourse. This film's themes,
apart from those about appearances, focus on the dangers of class power in China; when
upper classes gain too much power (such as in the case of these young rich men), they
are able to abuse the poor - who have no choice but to accept their fate.
97. A Simple Life (2012)
This film explores the plight of the' elderly in modern China - a household maid/
servant lives with a man whom she has taken care of since he was a child. The film is a
series of flashbacks of her retiring, moving to a nursing home, and passing away. Along
the way, the viewer is shown how the' man takes care of her, takes her to meals, and
generally treats her better than almost all of the older people are treated in the group
home. This film depicts filial piety better than films about actual mother-son
relationships; the man in this film has a very close relationship with his caretaker. W+L
describe how psychoses among main characters could be traced to "overindulgence by
the father or deprivation by the mother" (p. 122) - the main character here is incredibly
successful, and his caretaker/mother figure indulges him in whatever he wants.
98. Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (2012)
This film is a fairly standard historical drama with corrupt eunuchs, a people's
hero rebellion against the Emperor, "court" Mandarin, and a cat and mouse game
between members of the court for influence and control. There is a strong implication in
this film that women are property - which is different from many Chinese films where
women drive relationships forward. Deception plays a huge role in this film, as does
rebellion, but with respect to W+L themes, they are relatively few.
99. Million Dollar Crocodile (2012)
A massive escaped crocodile that has eaten a massive brick of euros (in cash) is
chased by a number of parties, in this Chinese take on a monster movie. Despite the
superficial premise, there are some interesting points to be made about expatriates and
the Chinese mindset. Of particular interest is the emphasis on cash, the characters in the
movie work with cash because they "can't touch or feel ... money in a bank." This film
shows some of the dangers of capitalism; capitalism has given people freedom to seek out
business opportunities, but these sometimes will hurt the environment.
100. The Resurrection: Painted Skin (2012)
Conflict in relationships and deception is at the core of this film. Relating the
story of a fox demon in her quest to achieve mortality by finding a true love, the film
portrays a general and a princess who reunite after 18 years of separation, with the fox
demon creating the third leg of the triangle: (as referenced in Leites' work). Key to this
film is seduction - both the princess and the demon seek to seduce the general, the
concept of seduction referenced heavily, in the Leites and Wolfenstein work. Here,
seduction is based not on love but on looks, and it is only at the end of the film that the
characters realize looks should be put aside (the general blinds himself). The fox demon
must find a love (and stop seducing, for her life is sustained by seducing men and eating
their hearts) to truly become happy; seduction is a means of survival (physical), but to
survive emotionally she needs actual meaning in love instead of just looks.
EARLIER FILMS
Queen of Sports (1934)
Queen of Sport is an early silent film depicting a young woman
who enters a sports training academy in Shanghai, by way of
her small town laojia in Zhejiang. This film is overtly
moralistic - the filmmakers view physical fitness as extremely
important for the strength of the nation. Interestingly, they
push back against the competitive aspects of sport; when the
young woman beings winning competitions, she falls out of
discipline - she starts going to bars, disregarding her
teachers, and performing poorly. It was only by returning to
the essence of sport - non-competitive and for personal
strength - that she was able to succeed.
"Why China is not strong, the chief reason is our bodies
1
1
:
are weak"
"The essence of sport is to keep everyone's body
developing and to popularize it to the whole society - not
to make a few individual heroes"
Song of the Fishermen (1934)
Song of the Fishermen is another silent leftist film from the
Golden Age of Chinese cinema. Another example of leftist
cinema, this film considers the plight of the poor class - as
compared to the rich. It is notable for the use of Ave Maria -
the operatic theme - in the soundtrack, repeating it again and
again. The use of western musical and media forms to express
essentially Chinese themes is interesting, and continues into the
Communist era.
"Why can't we live a simple life?"
"We are living a hard life in the countryside"
The Goddess (1934)
The Goddess is an example of Chinese silent film - hugely
popular films produced in the 1930s when film was still a new
industry in China. This is an example of leftist film in that
period; films that portrayed the plight of the poor, the
repression of the upper classes and government, and the need
for social change to address these problems. This film is
interesting in having a female character as its lead - and a
female prostitute at that - something that would largely
disappear as the Communist era began.
National Customs (1935) "
National Customs has a classic love triangle - two sisters who
are in love with the same cousin. Both sisters move to Shanghai
for their education. While one focuses on her studies and
excels, the other spends more time wearing fine clothes and
applying makeup. The moral message in this story is that such
extravagance is a waste; that when the nation is in danger,
Chinese must focus on protecting China - to educate
themselves for the good of the nation. This, along with other
leftist cinema of the 1930s, was intended to inspire the Chinese
people to unite and throw out the various foreign powers
occupying China at the time.
"If all the country folk in China emulated the modern city
people and cast off their virtues of frugality and
industriousness, that would be the end of the nation!"
"When the nation is in danger, imminent disaster is
everywhere ... we still have the idea to wear makeup and
jewelry, to be modern romantics"
The Big Road (1935)
The Big Road is an early silent film centered on national
defense. While the "enemy" is never mentioned, the film quite
openly refers to the Japanese invasion of northern China, and
Chinese peasants' attempts to build a road for the nationalist
army to travel to the north to fight the Japanese. One
important theme in this film is the nobility of work - the
laobaixing in this film work hard at building the road, but they
do it without complaint for the good of the country. The
peasantry of future Chinese films follow this example; working
away in distilleries, farms, fishing fleets, the army, etc - all in
the service of China.
"I have no children to sell///All I've got is me and my
vagrant flower-drum life"
Song at Midnight (1937)
Song at Midnight has one of the most complex plots in early
Chinese film - although that does not say much for Chinese
filmmakers themselves, as this film is actually an adaptation of
the French story, Phantom of the Opera. Of course, there is a
Chinese spin - while following the same basic story line, the
filmmakers could not resist inserting some political statements,
casting the major villain in the last act as a landlord who must
be defeated for the "freedom for the public."
"You are youth with hot liver, courage, and hope"
"We should work harder to struggle and break this dark
influence, fight for the freedom of the
public" (shoehorned political speech toward the end of
the film)
Street Angel (1937)
This film is one of the first sound films to come out in China - it
is an example of 1930s leftist film, intending to portray the
social evils present in China society, and arguing that they
needed to be fixed. Particularly, this film focuses on the plight
of the poor, looking at two young women; one, forced into
prostitution, the other sold by her adoptive parents to a local
gangster. While this film touches on many of the same themes
as later Communist-era films, it does so in a far more subtle
way.
"Do you really want a man to take care of domestic
affairs?"
Princess Iron Fan (1941)
This film is the first premiere-length animated film in Chinese
film history. It adapts an episode from Journey to the West - a
classic Chinese novel also portrayed in the 1961 film, Havoc in
Heaven - and employs extensive Rotoscoping. The influence of
Disney techniques and artistic forms is evident in the
animation. The film emphasizes slapstick humor and
deception/cleverness as the primary important themes.
"Scriptures are the principles that link heaven and
earth ... Only he who holds these principles can rid himself
of pain and live a good life, live a true and honest life"
"The reason that we've been defeated is that we haven't
been working together"
Spring in a Small Town (1948)
Spring in a Small Town is one of the most significant films to be
released during the Chinese Civil War prior to the Communist
takeover. This film is a story of love triangle in a small town
ruined by the Sino-Japanese War. An invalid landowner,
attended by his disinterested wife, his loyal servant, and his
younger system, is visited by his old friend - a western-dressed
doctor who happens to be his wife's former lover. One could
read this film in different ways - one interpretation could be
that the filmmaker was exploring the tension between the old
and the new China. The old China - the invalid - was dying
slowly of a consumptive disease, while the new China - the
doctor - represented a new breed of manliness. The film might
be a broader allegory for the rise of the Communists.
"He became my husband. I serve him. I have to serve him
faithfully. My heart is yours. But I feel sorry for Liyan.
What would have me do?"
Liu Hulan (1950)
Liu Hulan is a propaganda film about a Chinese revolutionary
martyr - a 14 year old girl named Liu Hulan who was
decapitated by Nationalist soldiers after refusing to recant her
Communist ideology in a small town square. The film is a
biopic that spins the Communist party in a favorable light; it
shows landlords collaborating with Japanese oppressors, and
in by now a familiar story, the common people joining together
with the Communist soldiers (the Eighth Route Army) to
throw back the invaders. The culmination of the film, when Liu
Hulan sacrifices herself in front of her neighbors, is meant to
be an inspirational scene designed to unite viewers together in
a common sense of Chinese unity.
"These are all from our sweat and efforts, they should
belong to us"
"All poor people will finally have hope. Today, I joined
the Communist party."
This Life of Mine (1950)
This Life of Mine is a good example of early Communist film;
chronicling the life of a policeman in Beijing during the
revolutions, wars, and political infighting of the Chinese Civil
War. The familiar themes of impotence against western
powers, the decay of the old society, and the CCP's role in
bringing glory back to China are visited here.
"Those big whigs eat freely, buy things freely ... What
have they ever done for the people?"
"Are you Chinese or not? Do you want to be ruled be
foreigners?"
Liu San Jie (1961)
This film relates a folk story about "third sister Liu" from the
1
Guangxi autonomous region. This is a musical film describing
conflict between ordinary peasants and landlords. Like many
films, it denounces landlords as rapacious, oppressive, and
calculating. The peasants rage at the landlords: "The rage in
our hearts cannot be checked." Liu San Jie defeats the
landlords in singing contests and upon capture, disappears by
jumping into a river and swimming away.
"The landlord is proud and arrogant. He raises a knife to
kill me at midnight"
"We have no share of the worldly wealth, but folk songs
belong to we poor"
"You're merely the landlord's dog under the table ... How
many bones can you eat?"
The Red Detachment of Women (1961)
This is a film celebrating the heroism of female members of the
PLA during the fighting against the Nationalists in the early
1930s. One of the main messages of this film is that all Chinese
- men and women alike - suffered from the excesses of the old
society, which must be destroyed to usher in a Communist-led
new society. The familiar themes of sacrifice, duty, and
martyrdom show up here. This film is interesting for
portraying Chinese women - while they are independent, they
are still subordinate to men.
"I will kill the officials ... I will rip off their dog skins ... "
"You think you are the only one with animosity? Every
proletarian feels it in their hearts"
Serfs (1963)
Serfs is a clear propaganda film that pushes forward the
narrative that the Chinese Communist Party is the unifier of
China and liberator of the oppressed. This film is set in Tibet,
where the local feudal customs were still in place ahead of the
PLA invasion. Upon liberation, the serfs throw aside their
chains and are finally free. This film is interesting in its use of
deception - the rebel feudal lords in Tibet utilize deception
techniques to fight the PLA, but the PLA - with its moral
supremacy - has no need for such tactics and wins handily.
"Today I see China gathering together and growing stronger
and wealthier"
The East is Red (1965)
This propaganda film is unique among major Chinese films - it
is a musical. This film tells the party's version of 20th century
Chinese history; it traces the founding of the Chinese
Communist Party, the war against the Japanese, the victory in
the civil war, and the founding of the PRC - along with all the
attendant suffering the Party and the Chinese people
experienced before their liberation. Unity is the major theme of
this film - unity of the Chinese people against reactionaries and
foreign aggressors in building a new China. One of the most
interesting aspects of this film is its seeming relation to Beijing
operatic forms in the dancing and singing.
"The Communist Party is like the sun ... Wherever the
Communist Party is the people are liberated"
""Without the Communist Party, no new China"
The Burning of Yuan Ming Yuan (1983)
This is a propaganda film covering the familiar themes of
China's exploitation by foreign powers, the corruption and
impotence of the late Imperial period, and the heroism of
China's peasants in doing what they could to resist the
"bandits." This film describes the burning of the Imperioal
gardens in Beijing during the Second Opium War. It is unusual
for its depiction of (historically inaccurate) brutality by
western forces in sacking Beijing.
"Her lust for dictatorship still burns like a flame even
after death"
"He was a disgrace to his ancestors ... He put the people's
lives at the hands of the savage enemy troops"
Yellow Earth (1984)
Yellow Earth is a prime example of Fifth Generation
filmmaking. One of the hallmarks of the Fifth Generation is a
move away from traditional narrative forms - with emphasis
on story and dialogue - and moving toward storytelling by
cinematography, form, and color. With a minimalistic color
palette and sweeping scenes of a desolate countryside, Chen
Kaige and Zhang Yimou turn what could be a traditional piece
of Communist propaganda - a story of a CCP cadre visiting a
peasant family in hopes of finding folk songs - into a story
about the ambiguity of human power. The Communists will
come to save us, the peasants sing, as they perform a rain
dance to alleviate a major drought. The main story - a peasant
girl being sold to another family to debts - could be viewed as
an allegory about the changes China faced in the early 1980s;
would China enter the future or remain in its past?
"If a boy gets married it's happiness; if a girl gets
married it's sadness"
Red Sorghum (1987)
This film is one of the seminal achievements of the Fifth
Generation - that generation of directors who graduated from
the Bejing Film Academy in 1982 - and it is the debut of Zhang
Yimou, one of the Fifth Generation's most famous figures. This
is a film that evokes passion, love, emotion, and the desire to
feel - focusing on a portrayal of peasant life at a sorghum
liquor distillery just before (and during) the Sino-Japanese
War. This film shows what directors WANTED to portray, but
were kept from portraying, during the Cultural Revolution.
"A name is as important to a liquor as it is to a human
being"
The Horse Thief (1988)
This film, The Horse Thief, has very little dialogue. Rather, it is
a view of how China's minorities are portrayed by the CCP.
This film is more of an ethnographic look - portraying the
sweeping panoramas of Tibet, and how a small Tibetan village
deals with crime and punishment. The film is ambivalent about
it; it portrays a primitive society practicing traditional values -
neither suggesting that it is bad or that the modern way is
better.
"The good are rewarded with good ... If he's reincarnated,
his life will be good. Yes, the vultures won't touch the
evil"
"Norbu has offended god. He stole the officials' temple
gifts. The government wants strict punishment ... We'll go
according to our rules. The punishment will be the exile.
He has to leave our town. Forever."
Farewell My Concubine (1993)
Farewell My Concubine is an epic that spans a half century of
Chinese history, examining some of the most turbulent
historical episodes of the 20th century. The film follows two
main characters - two opera singers trained from childhood to
practice Beijing Opera. The film is at once an historical epic
portraying the Japanese invasion, the Chinese civil war, the
rise of the Communist Party, and the chaos of the Cultural
Revolution - but at the same time a melodrama exploring the
relationship between the two actors. The film was at first
banned in China - its themes of preserving individualism and
idiosyncrasy in the face of historical forces and fate did not sit
well with Party censors, nor did its portrayal of the Red
Guards' actions during the Cultural Revolution. This is one of
the core works of the Fifth Generation of filmmakers - and was
one of the first Chinese films to attract wide attention outside
of China.
"The Communists still have to have opera ... We're just
waiting to see what their money looks like?"
''Only execution can satisfy the People's anger"
Frozen (1996)
Frozen is a unique film in the Chinese canon - it seems
like more of a reflection of what a small group of artists
in Beijing were feeling in the early 1990s rather than any
type of grand political statement or even a standard film.
It describes the plan of a discontented performance
artist to commit suicide by freezing himself to death -
representing the numbness of life. This film was banned
in China, and it reflects the discontent of many Chinese
artists during the period.
"That's no reason to arrest them, they only
expressed themselves"
"The hygiene of the mind is more important than
keeping China's streets clean"

15. Appendix 2: Some themes in John Weaklands work and mini-lit review
Review - J.H. Weakland's work on China and Chinese film
Weakland is well-known for his contributions to family therapy and psychology, but he
also contributed to the study of China., Weakland's concerns himself with the use of
imagery in Chinese mass media, particularly in film. In work for the US government and
in work in academic journals, Weakland considered major themes in Chinese film in the
1960s, applying psycho-cultural or socio-cultural research methods to think about the
meaning of film in the broader contexts of Chinese society. This review will survey
Weakland's major works in the area of China and in film.
Working with Margaret Mead in the early 1950s, Weakland considered images of family
in Chinese film. When watching films, he emphasized "a striking shift of mood; a
repetition of some feature, object, expression, or detail of structure; emphasis in
characterization or custom; or details of technique, such as camera work in beginning and
ending scenes" (Weakland, 1953a, 292). It is unclear whether at this point he understood
spoken Chinese, or relied on English translations of synopses and conversations with
Chinese-speaking associates.
In seven Cantonese films, he considered two major areas: roles and relations in the family
and time perspectives. With regard to the family, he observed that "although China is a
country where the ideal family is a very large one, a complete family seldom appears, and
an extended family is not shown" (Weakland, 1953a, 292). The core of the films are a
man-woman relationship, and fathers and mothers are not shown, along with siblings or
children. Young men are shown as ineffectual, dependent upon olden men for their
fortunes and is dependent upon them: Young women follow a given role strictly, but
holds the powerful weapon of public announcement of mistreatment (although always
against a situation and not a person) (Weakland, 1953a, 292-293). With respect to time
perspectives, Weakland observes how ' repetition is a prominent feature and the
"importance of destiny and the inescapable weight of circumstances are
stressed" (Weakland, 1953a, 294). He suggests this might mean the Chinese themselves
view destiny as inescapable and impossible to change.
In another piece in the same volume, Weakland applies his understanding of Chinese
family structure to China's role in international affairs. He notes that Chinese Communist
discussion of international affairs is not in pure Marxist terms, it includes family imagery.
He demonstrates how Chinese writing describes international affairs as "two families of
brothers" (Weakland, 1953b, 422), with the Soviet Union and the United States as the
heads of the families. How would China react if its older brother asked it to do
something?
In a 1966 note on Chinese film derived from research funded by the Office of Naval
Research, Weakland describes major themes in Chinese Communist film, which at the
time was strongly controlled by the state" Between 1962-1964 he viewed 17 films
produced by Communist producers, with 11 made in China and 6 in Hong Kong. The
:
films were dated 1956-1962 and represented a number of genres, including adaptations of
Chinese opera, films of historical or ancient China, and some looks at modern China
(Weakland, 1966, 478). He identifies four main stages of Chinese historical development
manifest in the films: (1) The Old Chinese Society and Its Evils; (2) Transitional
Struggles for Social Change; (3) The New Chinese Society and Its Virtues; and (4)
Continuing Social Tasks and Future Goals (Weakland, 1966, 479). The themes portrayed
are oriented around these stages.
These political themes include (1) The Feudalistic Family; (2) The Liberation of Women;
(3) The Liberation of Youth; (4) Reactionary Figures - officials and landlords; (5)
Revolutionary Figures; (6) "Anti-individualism"; (7) Education and Training; (8)
Minority Peoples; and (9) Invaders (Weakland, 1966, 479-481). Weakland relates these
themes together in a broader cultural pattern)-"behavior and social relationships based
on personal initiatives and responsibility, if conceived at all, are evaluated as uncertain
and dangerous in outcome" (Weakland, 1966, 482). Individualism is overtly attacked and
irresponsible; behavior should be ordered according to formal, established, non-personal
rules of social role, guided by authority figures.
In addition to thinking about general themes, Weakland also focuses on specific themes
and how films use imagery to portray them. In a 1968 report for the Office of Naval
Research, Weakland considers 22 feature films produced in China between 1949-1965
and explores images of invasion, resistance to invasion, and Chinese attitudes toward
foreign imperialism (Weakland 1968, i). While Weakland does not specify an explicit
methodological approach, he is generally concerned with non-rational socio-cultural
factors in film that could speak to broader attitudes.
Weakland identifies a number of occurrences and broad themes in these films. First, he
notes that most films regularly center on young women, with commonly oppressed as
helpless victims of invaders. There also seems to be a parallel between the concept of
arranged marriage and the husband being an invader into a woman's life and the broader
idea of China's foreigners serving as intrusive fathers/husbands. In this sense, China
serves as a maternal figure in the eyes of ordinary Chinese. Weakland, however, notes
that as a baseline, it would be valuable to study American attitudes as reflected in film -
similar views could be held there that do not make Chinese attitudes out of the ordinary
(Weakland, 1968, ii and 32). Out of this report, Weakland also published an article in
1971 on the same topic. He reports the same general results and way forward (Weakland,
1971a).
He suggested Hong Kong films as relevant as much as he did mainland films and in 1971
proposed that Hong Kong be used as a, laboratory for the process of social change and
development, particularly when compared to Taiwan and the mainland. Specifically, he
proposes to study film - as "films offer a cultural distillate that otherwise is rare in large
societies, and that has many advantages for study. Films are composed of interrelated
concrete images of individual behavior in social situations of common
concern" (Weakland, 1971b, 239). While they are fiction, social organization and
behavior are rarely based strictly on fact. Films exemplify culturall structured perceptions
and responses and provide commonly shared interpretations of society (Weakland, 1971b,
1
239-240).
Weakland's interest in imagery is not restricted to film. He also considers family imagery
(his great interest) in writing - specifically by Mao Tse-Tung. In one passage, Mao was
concerned with the evolution of Chinese social structure with the end of feudalism - the
crux of his argument is:
..
The invasion of foreign capitalism broke up with [feudal] economy of the
Chinese society. This invasion of foreign capitalist, on the one hand,
destroyed the self-sufficiently natural economy of China, the town
handicraft and the rural home handicraft; whilst on the other hand, it had
promoted the development of the town and rural commodity economy.
Using a content analysis approach, Weakland considers Maos' general form of expression
and its interpretation with respect to his thoughts on family structures in general.
Weakland's interpretation after applying this approach is that the old Chinese society is a
female figure, a conception legendary in nature and scope, which was "invaded" or raped
by foreign capitalism (a male, paternal figure). This led to her gradual death but the birth
of twins - the Chinese proletariat and capitalist classes that formed a new society as the
old died (Weakland, 1958, 393). Weakland's thinking on Chinese family structures and
their role in society extended as far back as at least 1958, and in this article one can see
the origins of the thinking he later applied to film. Weakland followed up his report with
a 1967 report for the Office of Naval Research considering many of the same themes,
emphasizing the relevance of
Weakland's interest was broadly related to Chinese culture. In a 1950 article, he considers
the "organization of sequences of related activity in Chinese culture, the whole sphere of
"purposive" behavior" (Weakland, 1950, 361). His objective was to describe major
patterns in activity organization (relationships among elements of purposive, visible,
behavior) and to relate those toward an overall configuration of society.
Crucially, in Weakland's dealings with Chinese nationals, he observes "in the situations
described above that the preparations carried out or planned were ordinarily undisclosed
by the planner, not revealed to others who were to be involved, until the moment for them
to act arrived" (Weakland, 1951, 363). This echoes some Chinese cultural elements of
deception. He also describes the "extensive use of middlemen" in getting things done
(Weakland, 1951, 364), what in the modern era we would call guanxi. Planning in
secrecy and execution with middlemen are therefore major patterns in Chinese
organization.
Weakland also thought about the Chinese Cultural Revolution. He considers the possible
relationships the movement might have to Chinese culture more generally, considering
Maoist pronouncements on the movement; the"Red Guards, and the education revolution.
Weakland argues "although both the proponents and opponents of the Cultural
Revolution have emphasized its newness and novelty, it regularly displays reliance and
even increased emphasis on traditional cultural patterns (Weakland, 1969, i). Weakland
incorporates drama in his analysis with a long description of changes to stage drama and
.
opera (Weakland, 1969, 34-6). In all discussion of Chinese cultural elements Weakland
includes such analysis of live portrayal of drama.
In what way did the Cultural Revolution reflect traditional Chinese culture even though it
promoted so much that was new? Weakland cites the example of the Red Guards leading
a wide campaign to rename streets; schools, towns, etc. Names and naming has been very
important for an extremely long time in Chinese history; while promoting the new, the
Red Guards invoked the old (Weakland; 1969, 38). Weakland argues the Cultural
Revolution, with this sort of cultural revitalization, could represent the ultimate step in
Chinese revolution, to reconnect the old with the new.
Working with Ruth Bunzel, Weakland produced a report funded by the Office of Naval
Research in 1952 taking an anthropological approach to Chinese Communism and
exploring its similarities and differences with the Soviet model. This report did not utilize
film, although Nathan Leites and Martha Wolfenstein were both consulted in its drafting.
They consider three areas of traditional Chinese culture: "(1) traditional patterns of
thinking; (2) the organization of life experience, with special reference to the perception
of bodily function and family relationships, and (3) counter-tendencies inherent in
traditional Chinese culture or developed in it as a result of contact with the west" (Bunzel
and Weakland, 1952, i). They also note how "Chinese Communism is consciously
modeled on Soviety Communism (Bunzel and Weakland, 1952, x). Chinese Communism
is conditioned, in their view, by traditional Chinese thought blended with Soviet
Communist concepts.
Weakland's work with the Office of Naval Research also included research into film. He
was the PI for a research contracted done on "Chinese Communist Communication and
Values" from the Group Psychology Branch for the Office of Naval Research. He wrote a
series of six technical reports (all of which are referenced here) and submitted several as
academic publications (Weakland, 1970).
Weakland produced several other reports for ONR that have not been publically released;
the Defense Technical Information Center only digitized them upon request for this
report. A 1967 report based on 21 Chinese films considered family relationships. It is
important to note none of these were mainland films - Weakland's sample included six
from Hong Kong made under Chinese influence, 12 other Hong Kong films, and five
Taiwanese films (Weakland, 1967, 1). He emphasizes major themes that can be discerned
through the films, emphasizing the conflict between love and family relationships. He
considers the depicted nature of these conflicts, the sources to which conflicts are
ascribed, and their typical resolutions.
Interestingly, Weakland considers the methodology to be a straightforward - his aim was
to closely observe to discern repetitive main elements, and then compare Communist
Chinese and Taiwanese films.
Weakland reports that in all three groups, conflict had one main focus: children were in
conflict with parents about romantic attachments, but there were differences apart from
this (Weakland, 1967, 4). In the Communist Chinese group, the films either depict the
evils of "Old China" or the benefits of "New China" - Communism rescuing the Chinese
people (Ibid.). In "Old China," when young people come into conflict with parents, they
are always defeated, implying nothing can really change in the old system. This becomes
resolved in new China.
In Taiwanese films, there appears to be an emphasis on fate prescribing certain outcomes
(Ibid.). Occasionally negative outcomes are blamed on the Communists. Additionally,
Taiwanese films do not blame parents for conflict. They propose that the young should
adapt to the status quo, rather than in Chinese. film where the emphasis is on struggle
(Weakland, 1967, 6). Both groups advocate subordination of personal love to wider social
ends, but they differ in what those ends should be.
Weakland also reports the study has implications for understanding social change,
particularly in revolutionary situations. Rather than viewing there to be a dichotomy
between change or continuity, Weakland argues that change and continuity are
interrelated in situations of change and they should be considered hand in hand
(Weakland, 1967, 8).
In an earlier report, Weakland considered 17 films representing Communist Chinese film
output. He looked for what political themes were manifest in film and what cultural
themes are related to the political messages. Weakland identified nine main political
themes: (1) the feudalistic family, (2) the liberation of women, (3) the liberation of youth,
(4) reactionary figures (officials and landlords), (5) revolutionary figures, (6) anti-
individualism, (7) education and training, (8) invaders, (9) national minorities (Weakland,
1966, 1). These themes are interrelated, but Weakland identifies anti-individualism as
being particularly important. Interestingly, anti-individualism and several of the others
are old Chinese themes, not indicative of the Communists forcing new culture upon the
Chinese.
Weakland describes these themes in the context of strategic deterrence, which relies on an
adversary nation's interpretation of action. Being raised in a particular national culture
plays a large role in shaping perception and reality and effects the evaluation of any issue.
These may be implicit or explicit. To predict how a state will react to deterrence
operations, it is important to understand a, nation's way of viewing political events -
knowledge of basic premises of political' life is important (Weakland, 1966, 3-4). In
Weakland's view, "knowledge of more general Chinese Communist cultural system of
conceptions, attitudes, and premises (and something of its relationship with traditional
Chinese cultural patterns) ... is important for a clear view of domestic Chinese Communist
politics" (Weakland, 1966, 4). Films, therefore, present valuable information because
they serve as deliberate interpretation and systematization of content and pattern related
to culture. Weakland additionally argues that film is superior to literature as an object of
analysis. Films are more culturally representative because they are group projects and
intended for wide communication and present general and basic themes (Weakland, 1966,
6).
What kind of work did this research serve? Weakland used cultural analysis to better
understand Chinese Communist views and practices concerning strategy and negotiation.
He relies primarily on Chinese literature, including Sun Tzu and Lo Kuan-Chung, to
generate a sort of Chinese strategic culture (Weakland, 1970, 17-22). Weakland considers
relationships and social interaction were handled in these cultural artifacts to relate to
politico-military strategy. He claims for the Chinese Communists, the point of strategy
was to "enmesh the enemy in such contradictions until he is eventually defeated by his
inability to resolve them, while the Communists aim to win by taking positive strategic
advantage of contradictions" (Weakland, 1970, 36). There is a strong relation to Sun Tzu.
He further argues that because of this, the Chinese take an "adversary" approach to
negotiations. They view negotiation as another type of struggle
Differences from Leites
Weakland drew from the Wolfenstein and Leites volume when doing his own work.
These are the main themes Weakland identified from his study of film:
(1) the feudalistic family, (2) the liberation of women, (3) the liberation of youth, (4)
reactionary figures (officials and landlords), (5) revolutionary figures, (6)
antiindividualism, (7) education and training, (8) invaders, (9) national minorities
(Weakland, 1966, 1).
He also considers how in Chinese film, conflict had one main focus: children were in
conflict with parents about romantic attachments, but there were differences apart from
this (Weakland, 1967, 4). He also notes how there is a dichotomy between films depicting
"Old" and "New" China.
Some of Weakland's work differs slightly from Leites' in that it explicitly seeks a
political motivation to film, though the research is based on the psycho-cultural approach
used in the Wolfenstein and Leites book. Leites, on the other hand, emphasizes broader
themes like Weakland's less, focusing more on different types of characters and
relationships among them. Leites also considers certain plot devices and how they help to
show character interaction. Leites also seeks comparison across different countries where
Weakland considered only China.
Weakland does have significant work thinking about family relationships in film, so there
is some overlap. But where he considers political and strategy factors, Leites sticks to
thinking about relationships and characters. Weakland and Leites therefore emphasize
different aspects of the films. Leites focuses on the foundations in the film - characters
and relationships, while Weakland builds' on such analysis to relate film to larger
questions of theme and cultural strategy ::
