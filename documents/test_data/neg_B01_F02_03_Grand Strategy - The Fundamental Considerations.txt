Abstract: Grand or national strategy has emerged as a critical issue in security studies.
Adam Garfinkle recently opined that American grand strategy has died a silent death.
Too much attention has been devoted to definitions, or debates over the utility of strategy.
Not enough consideration has been given to the complexities of actually building a robust
strategy amidst that effectively integrates all elements of national power within a complex
bureaucracy. Oddly, the exclusion of politics contradicts our understanding of war and
conflict. Likewise, not enough attention has been applied to the fundamental components of
building a competitive strategy that can be sustained over time. This essay offers an
introductory discussion of the basic considerations or components of national strategy.

This article deals with grand strategy, a subject that the last decade of conflict
suggests remains highly relevant to students of strategic studies. Some have
questioned the need for grand strategy at all; others lament the lack of one in
America.1 Other scholars argue that the United States has lost the art of developing
grand strategy and needs to regain its strategic competence.2 A number of books,

drawn equally from both sides of the Atlantic, suggest that both the United States
and United Kingdom share a common problem with conceptualizing and
conducting national strategy.
The recent track record suggests that strategic results have been subpar.
Whatever one thinks about the level of success obtained in Iraq and Afghanistan, it
is hard to overlook the 6,000 lives lost and the $2 trillion spent and conclude that
good strategies were developed or executed. What national interests were secured
and how did Allied actions achieve those desired ends, and at what cost? It brings
to mind the comment of General William Howe regarding the pyrrhic British
victory at Bunker Hill: "the success is too dearly bought." So, too, was "success" in
the last decade.
Not everyone agrees that sound strategy is a solution. Richard Betts has
suggested that grand strategy is an illusion, and another American scholar of
government has argued:
Grand strategy has always been seductive because it promises policy
coherence in the face of complexity. Yet the sorry truth is that American
grand strategies are usually alluring but elusive. Containment during the
Cold War, the most often cited example of grand strategy success, is a
recent lonely exception that has driven political scientists and policy
makers to keep hope alive. That hope is misguided. In the post-9/11
world, forging a successful grand strategy is unlikely and dangerous. 3
Other scholars suggest we stick to what former State Department
planning official Stephen Krasner called "orienting principles" instead of grand
visions of how we want to see the future unfold.4 Professor Amy Zegart of
UCLA agrees that while principles are not glamorous, "they hold out the
prospect of something better than foreign policy a la carte or a grand strategy that
mis-estimates the threat environment and misunderstands the organizational
requirements for success."5
This is a pessimistic conclusion, and not a very useful prescription.
There is nothing wrong with principles, but they have to be applied in context

and they require the prudent exercise of power to implement them.6 Principles
can be the foundation of a sound strategy, but they do not serve to shape and
develop the necessary instruments of national power required to achieve desired
effects and objectives by themselves. Nor do principles help create a reality-
tested set of tradeoffs or a risk assessment worthy of its name. A true strategy
does. Principles are necessary but not sufficient.
Difficult as it is, strategy is not an illusion. We cannot avoid the discipline
without penalty in the future. We can and must do better. But first we'll have to
consider what strategy is, what its various components are, and what considerations
should influence its design.
The last decade clearly demonstrates a distinctive degradation in the ability
to weigh the national interest, and design effective strategies to achieve designated
goals at efficient levels of means. It is quite true that historically most major
powers have been deficient in grand strategy, as noted by Williamson Murray in The
Shaping of Grand Strategy.7 In his superbly argued book, What Good is Grand Strategy?,
Duke University's Hal Brands has noted that "grand strategy is neither a chimera
nor an elusive holy grail, but rather an immensely demanding task that talented
policy makers have still managed to do quite well."8
But to do better we will have to invest in a comprehensive education about
strategy-which involves grappling with the desirable, the immutable, and the
unknown. Deciphering which is which is what makes strategy hard work and an art.
A fundamental lesson from history is that strategy is necessarily purposeful, but
must be designed in a world of ambiguity, complexity, and uncertainty.
Strategy is elusive these days as the term has become too generalized and
has lost its meaning. But grand, or national, strategy does not have to remain lost by
modern practitioners of the art, whether they come from the civilian or military side.
Some historians and students of war have recently argued that strategy pertains only
to the use of military force. I find that limiting and ahistoric. Colin Gray's definition
of grand strategy is laudable: "the direction and use made of any or all the assets of a
security community, including its military instrument, for the purposes of policy as
decided by politics."9 If one accepts this, then true grand strategy requires the
conceptualization of all of the elements of national power. A narrow reading of
Clausewitz may have led some to a misinterpretation, but he did not rule out the
role of diplomacy or other instruments in either the preparation or conduct of war.
Nor do I agree that strategy is a competence or discipline that is performed uniquely

Grand Strategy
by military professionals as Hew Strachan has suggested in his most recent and rich
anthology The Direction of War.10
To help frame and examine the many factors that influence the direction
and use of our security assets, this article briefly lays out the most important eight
considerations. These represent the most critical components that both Clausewitz
and Colin Gray have sought to offer strategists, as they struggle to obtain their
nation's policy aims. It is these elements that collectively comprise a holistic
understanding of what grand or national strategy is and what makes strategy so easy
to conceive and so terribly difficult to implement successfully.
1. Context and Culture. Context is the basis for strategy, providing a grasp of
the strategic and operational environment in which one's strategy is to be
conducted. Professor Gray appropriately has referred to the "Sovereignty of
Context," to highlight its importance. He has also listed the sources of context we
should seek to understand; the political, military, socio-cultural, geographic,
technological, and historical contexts.11
Comprehending the strategic context
frames our understanding of our adversary and the particular environment in which
our strategies must operate within. The notion of strategic culture as a frame of
reference for understanding strategic thinking and the distinctive (but not
predictive) approaches of various cultures has some value. In his latest book, Gray
emphasizes that strategic culture is not fixed nor determinant but it does cue or
frame problem recognition and initially forms a lens on solutions.12 Hew Strachan
disagrees with the concept entirely, holding that it tends to be used prescriptively as
if foreign leaders were bound by it.13
But strategic culture is also a useful starting point for self-awareness,
something Americans are often lacking.14
Grand strategy, Williamson Murray
concludes, must also "rest on a realistic assessment and understanding not only of
one's opponents but also of oneself."15 American strategic culture tends to embrace
technological and short-term solutions to long-standing human problems. Cold
War grand strategies were formulated with an understanding of the culture we were
competing with, but also an understanding of our strengths and weaknesses.
In addition to strategic culture, we must appreciate the relevance of
geography, what Gray has called the mother of strategy.16

A good appreciation for context, geographical and cultural, goes far and
explains much about U.S. strategic performance. Shortfalls over the last decade in
Iraq and Afghanistan come partially from a lack of detailed comprehension of the
particular context and culture we sought to operate in. As Bernard Brodie noted
two generations ago, good strategy presumes good sociology and anthropology.17
Apparently both are in short supply among U.S policymakers and their close
advisors.
2. Constraints. The second consideration deals with limits. One makes
strategy and executes it in the real world, and the real world is an environment in
which constraints are almost always operative. The most obvious of which are time,
information and resources.
War in general and operations more explicitly are competitive and decisions
are made in an environment that rewards timely actions relevant to the opponent.
National strategies are longer term, but their implementation is still guided by time
limits. There is generally not enough time to make deliberative steps and there are
advantages to preempt one's adversary in the temporal dimension by anticipating,
deciding and action with time as a precious resource.
Information is another common constraint, despite prodigious amounts of
great intelligence. As Colin Gray has stressed, the future is not foreseeable and
strategy must be founded on assumptions, logic, and genius. It must also accept
known and unknown "unknowns." Uncertainty is just one of many constraints. 18
There are pundits in the United States that believe strategies should be
unconstrained, reflecting that American predisposition towards engineered solutions
and massive resources. The latest U.S. defense guidance, in support of our current
national strategy, is explicitly constrained with more explicit priorities in missions,
regions of interest and investment. As means become limited, it places greater
demands on the strategist to contrive creative' "ways" to overcome these limits.
The essence of strategy is the making of choices, prioritizing objectives, and making
tradeoffs. It is also about recognizing and accounting for risk and the unknown or
unknowable. As Harry Yarger once noted, policy ensures that strategy pursues
appropriate aims while strategy informs policy of the art of the possible.19 Thinking
of strategy without understanding the limits of means or resources is woefully
delusionary.
The United States has enjoyed a few decades of enormous technological
and material advantage-problems could be solved with massive funding or
expensive solutions. These advantages may have led to rust in the machinery and
practice of strategic thinking. That surplus of resources will be a thing of the past.

Grand Strategy
Future U.S. national security strategies will have to seek creative and relevant
solutions with fewer resources.
3.
Compromise and Consensus by Council. This element deals with the
development of strategies, the essence of strategy as a process not just a written or
implicit product. The discourse required to create and refine strategies are generally
achieved by committees or councils of war. Ultimately, policymakers and their
strategists "must weigh imponderables through structured debates that pare away
personal, organizational, and national illusions and conceits."20
They must squarely face the parochial predispositions of bureaucracy,
accurately discern strategic options, and make choices with imperfect information.
The metaphorical bridge function described by Professor Gray in The Strategy Bridge,
occurs often in summits, Cabinet meetings, or policy councils. Here strategists seek
to resolve or reconcile grand policy aims with practical operational ways and means
in an integrated way. What Eliot Cohen once called the "unequal dialogue" occurs
in these councils-the intense interaction between civilian and military
perspectives.21 Consensus need not mean lowest common denominator thinking
but it does imply an open discourse of contending perspectives. Whether it's an
unequal dialogue or collaborative confrontation, this discourse leads to better
strategy.22
Civil-military interaction in the development of strategy is critical to
strategic success, and, of course, a great source of tension.23 Within such councils,
the preferences of policy are contrasted with the gritty reality of ways and means.
As Colin Gray lucidly notes, national strategies are developed to support
the attainment of "policy as determined by politics."24 This is the best definition of
national strategy since politics are infused in policy and influence strategy, as well.
Politics need not be the. enemy of strategy; instead policymakers and strategists,
Brands argues, should embrace democratic messiness.25
Our strategists must also accept, as Clausewitz highlighted, that politics is
far more than just an intrusion into strategy and war. The strategist, who holds the
proverbial bridge between policy and military means, must accept the historical fact
that purely rational methods are not the norm in crafting strategy. Strategy's natural
spawning grounds are the confluence of politics, complexity, uncertainty and

constraints. This is obvious to anyone claiming to be a disciple of Clausewitz. But
our Prussian sage is more often quoted than read or understood, especially among
the U.S. military. As General David Petraeus commented once, "Though most
military officers quote flawlessly Clausewitz' dictum that war is a continuation of
politics by other means-many do not appear to accept fully the implications of his
logic."26
Strategies are usually the product of negotiation and compromise, and these
compromises are hammered out in councils of war and dialogue.27 These can be
contested debates of collaborative or creative confrontation. Too often the edges of
risk, assumptions and alternatives are watered down at lower levels. Leaders should
ensure that clear alternatives and debate are used productively to fully examine true
options.
In retrospect, the last decade reveals defects in the National Security
Council-centered system in its ability to pare away illusions, challenge shaky
assumptions, and parochial inclinations. Initial strategies were not well integrated
and failed to reconcile grand ambitions with operational plans generated by military
staffs. The NSC structure has been altered to enhance institutional integration, but
flaws in the conception of strategy across all the instruments of power at the council
table still exist. Too often operational planning was confused with strategic
thinking. Hew Strachan's lament is reinforced by this experience; the meaning of
strategy has been lost, and replaced by operational planning.28 They are not the
same.
4.
Competiveness. A strategy must be competitive. National strategies
should be based on the need to define, create and sustain a competitive
advantage relative to the opponent or the environment. This is not commonly
recognized:
What you often get instead are lists. Lists of geographic theaters, lists of
lofty goals Washington will seek there, lists of assets, etc. Seldom is there
much about the mechanics of how to execute the strategy, bringing about
all these wonderful things in the face of determined opposition.
Oftentimes it goes unmentioned that there is opposition.29

Grand Strategy
This is a consideration on behalf of which the Pentagon's Andrew Marshall
and other proponents, like Richard Rumelt, have argued.30 Competitive strategies
seek to frame the contest to our advantage rather than play by someone else's
rules.31 To craft a strategy that is competitive recognizes that it must operate in an
adversarial setting and reflect the reality that strategy and war are reciprocal, as well
as involve an interactive series of action, response, and counteraction.
This consideration is the essence of the strategy function, whereby the
strategist exploits the comprehension generated from context and cognitively creates
a strategic concept and logic that represents an untested hypothesis that promises to
attain policy ends within the means allotted and the constraints that exist. A good
strategy must have an internal logic that ties policy to both ways and means to create
desired strategic effects. That logic is a continuous thread of thinking that provides
strategic intent and informs ways, and creates linkages in strategic design that drives
the application of means via military operations. This factor is the component that
involves calculation, cunning, and the creation of a strategic logic or chain of effects.
The strategist's art or most important skill is devising a strategic logic that obtains
policy's goals within the given constraints and means.
The Cold War strategy of containment was predicated upon a strategic logic
that understood the inherent advantages of the West and sought to shore up the
capacity of democratic states to withstand the built-in contradictions of the Soviet
Union. Grand strategy since 1991 has not been built upon an explicit competitive
logic of action. Initial U.S. strategies in Afghanistan and Iraq too quickly dismissed
our adversary. We then strove hard to reassess and regain the initiative. Strategic
reviews in both wars had to work to gain an appreciation for events on the ground,
assess the right metrics, and design a renewed approach to obtain policy aims at
some reasonable cost. A failure to think competitively has squandered
opportunities in contemporary application, at great cost.

his creativity and experience. Coherence involves consistency in the logic that binds
ends/ways/means. The enduring formula of ends/ways/means must be logically
and coherently linked. If a strategy employs a "way" that is inconsistent with policy,
or if policymakers provide too little means, then it lacks coherence. The prospects
for success are very suspect if coherence is not sustained. Altering one part of the
formula automatically alters the resultant strategy, and if strategy cannot be
executed, it should force a reconsideration of the policy itself.
Coherence works in multiple directions horizontally and vertically. In the
horizontal dimension, coherent logic integrates in time and space the deployment of
all instruments of national power-the coherent linking of diplomacy, economic,
information and military tools. The strategic concept divined and proposed by the
strategist should establish this coherence-and he or she must strive mightily to
keep them connected in balance.
Coherence can also be considered vertically, in the consistent thread of
logic that ties strategy to operations to tactics. The debate about the use of drones
to support strike operations may be one example where coherence is difficult to
define and sustain.
Coherence in U.S. strategy sometimes has been suspect. Hew Strachan is
correct to criticize the U.S. national security community for a "profoundly
astrategic" approach in Iraq and the broader conflict against violent extremists.32
The need to think strategically about the ends/ways/means chain is quite evident in
the conduct of strategy in Iraq and Afghanistan. What was generally lacking or
astrategic about U.S. actions was the lack of a coherent linkage between desired ends
and the ultimate means required. Failures in council to create a strategic logic and
coherent linkages that bound. the application of military, diplomatic and
developmental resources to the desired strategic effect. Thanks to bureaucratic
blinders and personal blind spots inside the National Security Council and at the
theater command, American strategists have frequently struggled with preserving a
logic chain in recent conflicts.
Because of its attempt to minimize civilian interference in what it
erroneously defined as its professional sphere, Strachan criticizes the Powell
Doctrine and the U.S. military's devotion to the operational level of war for leaving
strategy without a home. Strategy deals less with the subordination of the military
effort to policy, and more about its proper harmonization-which is the function of
strategy. He contends "the true evil in war is the inability to hammer out how the
two are to be reconciled."33 The linkage between policy and effort is the coherence
that only strategy can provide.

Grand Strategy
6. Contingency. This is the often overlooked realm of chance in the
execution of strategy.34 In his opus Strategy: A History, Sir Lawrence Freedman
addresses its pernicious effects: "The inherent unpredictability of human affairs, due
to chance events as well as the efforts of opponents and the missteps of friends,
provides strategy with its challenge and drama."35
As Clausewitz noted, we do not fight or operate against inanimate objects,
but real people with ideas and a will of their own. Strategy operates as an inherently
human enterprise.36 There is no need to belabor the Prussian sage's emphasis on
friction in war. But it is not just a factor at the operational or tactical level of
warfare. It exists at all levels, including the conference table. Recall the words from
Winston Churchill, another Anglo-American with a strategic flair:
The Statesman who yields to war fever must realize that once the signal is
given, he is no longer the master of policy but the slave of unforeseeable
and uncontrollable events. Antiquated War Offices, weak, incompetent
or arrogant Commanders, untrustworthy allies, hostile neutrals, malignant
Fortune, ugly surprises, awful miscalculations-all take their seats at the
Council Board on the morrow of a declaration of war.37
We should note that Churchill failed to give well-meaning but misinformed
"civilian policymakers" a seat at the table in that list. Since he was certainly a
statesman deeply read in history and statecraft, this oversight can be forgiven. But
modern strategists must connect the disparate cultures of policymakers on one
hand, and the operational planners on the other. Policymakers may not always be as
familiar with the instrument they select or always grasp the logic of force or
understand its limits.
The conduct of U.S. strategy in the contemporary conflict over the last
decade, including the sudden collapse and reemergence of the Taliban, and al
Qaeda's attempt to interfere in Iraq, demonstrates the role of contingency and the
· need to respond to both opportunity and unanticipated circumstances. Our recent
threat of force against Syria shows how quickly a crisis can produce sudden
opportunities or pitfalls.
7. Continuous Assessment and Adaptation. The confluence of contingency and
competiveness produces the need for an additional component-that of constant
evaluation of ongoing operations and continuous measurement of progress. "Like
a vessel under sail," notes retired Army strategist Rick Sinnreich, "grand strategy is
at the mercy of uncontrollable and often unpredictable political, economic and
military winds and currents, and executing it effectively requires both alertness to
those changes and constant tiller correction."38

This is the basis for co-adaptation in form and function as our strategy
interacts with the real world and the will of an opponent. According to Oxford's
Hew Strachan, we must recognize that in war, the creation and execution of strategy
are locked into an iterative relationship, which rests on an inherently dynamic and
changing situation and which has to respond to the counters of the enemy.39 No
strategy should be seen as unalterable or a fixed blueprint written in stone.40 Good
strategists, Dr. Rich Hooker, former NSC staffer observes, "must be ready to
jettison failed policies and strategies and make new ones when needed."41
Operational planners are well versed in the need for crafting branches and
sequels to plans to account for critical points in campaigns. The virtue for branches
in national strategy should not be underestimated. "Good strategy development
provides for flexibility and adaptability," one commendable strategist has noted, "so
that planning and execution can be tailored to more immediate circumstances and
respond to unanticipated opportunities and constraints."42
Since strategy is an evolving contact sport, one should avoid what Lord
Salisbury called the most common error, "sticking to the carcass of dead policy."
Strategies should be thought of as adaptive in nature. As Henry Mintzberg has
stressed, the making of strategy is an iterative exercise that is dynamic, irregular,
discontinuous, with learning and synthesis.43 Mintzberg's views from the corporate
world match a deep body of historical work on grand strategy. Strategy has to be
seen as a process, "a constant adaptation to shifting conditions and circumstances in
a world where chance, uncertainty, and ambiguity dominate."44 Freedman echoes
Mintzberg and his emphasis on adaptive or emergent strategy, and stresses that
grand strategy has to involve feedback and course corrections. An essential aspect
of strategic leadership is the creation of an atmosphere in which honest
reassessment can occur. 45
Mechanisms and assets to objectively produce this continuous evaluation
and adaptation have now been created in our NSC structure. They should be
retained if not strengthened. The strategy process does not end with the decision to
select an option, it must endure as strategy is executed and eventually evaluated.
Purpose and process-one requires the other in the making and conduct of
effective grand strategy.

Grand Strategy
8. Communication. The importance of narratives in explaining national
purpose, myths, and goals should not be underestimated. Policymakers need to
create and sustain support for a national or grand strategy, particularly in democratic
states. Strategies need to be sustained by support, and to be sustained, they must be
explained.
A good national security strategy does not have to be an inspiring
document, but it should paint a compelling narrative and a clear direction. Most
importantly, it cannot be simply aspirational, merely listing a litany of desired
objectives with little discussion of "how" these objective are to be achieved or in
what priority. Even if too long-range or too inspirational in tone (as some are), and
too general, it can be the basis for subordinate plans by the subordinate instruments
of national power. But one of its critical purposes is to establish a narrative that
influences the principal audience(s), allots priorities and allocates resources to shape
and apply the instruments of national power towards a common purpose.
The need to create and promulgate a strategic narrative is not new to our
leaders. From Woodrow Wilson's 14 Points, to the issuance of the Atlantic Charter
by Franklin D. Roosevelt and Churchill, to Ronald Reagan as the Great
Communicator, the value of a strategic narrative has been understood in the United
States. "Grand strategy requires great language," is an observation from John Lewis
Gaddis that should be taken to heart.46 Strategy returns to issues of language and .
communication "because strategy is meaningless without them."47 But such a
compelling narrative has been hard to craft since 1991. Certainly, in the aftermath
of 9/11, there was a narrative that was naturally reactive to the tragedy. But we have
been less consistent in explaining and defending our role in the world and the global
struggle against violent extremism since the Iraq invasion. As Lawrence Freedman
and Emile Simpson have noted, the importance of a persuasive narrative in
contemporary conflict is now well established.48
But strategic narratives are necessary too, and one must search hard today
to find that national story today beyond the "rebalance" to the Pacific and nation-
building here at home. As Adam Garfinkle wrote recently, "A nation does not have.
a grand strategy if those responsible for devising and implementing it cannot
articulate what it is."49 He may be correct in bemoaning the silent death of
American grand strategy.
These eight considerations cannot be thought of in isolation. The art of
strategy requires consideration of what Colin Gray has called the "whole house."50

The various elements interact and even create tension. Hal Brands has captured the
same conclusion:
Indeed the more one studies grand strategy, the more one can see that the
·very concept is beset by a number of fundamental tensions- between the
quest for coherence and the reality of complexity; between the need for
foresight and the fact of uncertainty; between the steadiness and purpose
that are necessary to plan ahead, and the agility that is required to adapt
on the fly.51
Conclusion
A grand strategy ensures that policy and strategic machinery are aligned
and in good working order. Strategy should purposely link policy aims to
competitive ways, with sustainable means. While many strategy documents claim to
be strategy, events over the last two decades suggest that the common
understanding of what strategy entails needs updating. Likewise, institutional
mechanisms and intellectual concepts need revising. Given that the margin for
error is shrinking, by a combination of increased challenge and reduced resources,
we can no longer afford to be indifferent to strategy in the real arena of a multi-
polar world. While the United States and NATO remain quite powerful, relative
decline in power can be offset with better strategy implementation to preserve order
and advance our interests.
We need to reinvest and conduct "good" strategy if we are to avoid wasting
the lives of American warriors and improvidently expending our dwindling treasury.
Strategy must be more than mere fluff; it cannot be founded upon an inadequate
diagnosis or simply a mere list of goals.52 As Hal Brands concluded, "Refusing to
do grand strategy will not allow the United States to escape the dilemmas that make
that task so difficult; it will only exacerbate the confusion and contradictions within
American policy."53
Overall this framework of eight considerations offers a useful guide for
thinking about strategy. These factors provide a foundation to think about, design
and apply a national strategy. A proper appreciation of these components will
increase the likelihood that U.S. national strategies will have a better chance of
success in the future.

Grand strategy is difficult work and far more is involved than writing a
glossy publication with the White House crest on the cover. Strategies, both the
process and the product, are essential to spanning the black hole from desired policy
aims to achieved strategic effect. There is a calculation and compromise involved in
crafting and implementing sound strategy, and while the difficulties might appear

insurmountable, it must be done. As Clausewitz said, in war the simplest of things
are not necessarily easy. The same is true for strategy.
