MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

SUBJECT: Key Military Balances

Attached are very brief statements of my assessment of the four
military balances we discussed yesterday:

-- Strategic balance
-- Central front balance
-- Naval balance
-- Comparative capability to project military power into
   political crisis areas.

I have focused upon what my best assessment is, but in a fuller
treatment of these balances I believe that one should also include
(1) judgments as to how the Soviets and our allies (or other third
parties) see the particular balances, and (2) an assessment of the
capabilities of the U.S. and Soviet Union to continue the military
competition in that area.
