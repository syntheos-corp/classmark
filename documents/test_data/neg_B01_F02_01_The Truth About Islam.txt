And so, in a series of colossal foreign-
policy blunders, President Obama has
actively sided with jihadists in both mili-
tary and political conflicts-going beyond
appeasement to render actual aid (or to
attempt to render aid) to some of the
world's most extreme Islamic movements.
In Libya, we used the might of NATO
airpower to tip the balance in the civil
war to a motley collection of jihadists -.
jihadists who later thanked us by over-
running our diplomatic compound in
Benghazi (killing four Americans) and
most recently have been filmed swim-
ming in our ambassador's pool in Tripoli.
In Egypt, we immediately affirmed
our support for the Muslim Brother-
hood government and promised to.con-
tinue arms shipments (including F-16s
and M1 Abrams tanks) even as the
Muslim Brotherhood stood aside and
allowed a screaming mob to overrun
our embassy, launched a nationwide
campaign of persecution against Egypt's
Coptic Christian minority, violated the
Camp David Accords by moving heavy
weapons into the Sinai, and provided
direct aid and comfort to Hamas, a
State Department-designated terror
organization.
Even worse, when the Muslim Broth-
. erhood was overthrown, in what some
have called the largest political protests
in history, and replaced with a govern-
ment that cut off Hamas, restored coop-
eration with Israel, and took steps to
protect the Copts, only then did we end
our military aid.
In Gaza, Secretary of State John Kerry
defied both Egypt and Israel to advance
Hamas's key allies-Turkey and Qatar-
in cease-fire talks, leading to angry de-
nunciations in Israel and one of the worst
diplomatic crises in the long history of the
American-Israeli alliance. Using the lan-
guage of moral equivalence to describe
the terror tactics of Hamas and the lawful
military actions of Israel was its own
appalling scandal.
In Syria, the Obama administration
· has repeatedly sought to arm and support
jihadists fighting the Assad regime (and
now allegedly fighting ISIS). These
jihadists are every bit as brutal as Assad,
have reportedly signed non-aggression
pacts with ISIS, and have apparently
already allowed American-supplied
weapons to fall into ISIS's hands.
And now we face a Middle East in
flames, strained relations with key allies
(Israel, Egypt, and the Kurds), and
jihadists controlling more territory with
more men under arms than before 9/11.
This summary doesn't even include
Iran's growing strength and our looming
exit from Afghanistan, where President
Obama's idealistic "benevolent coun-
terinsurgency" (Bing West's excellent
description in his recent book One Mil-
lion Steps) has largely failed to create
conditions similar to those that followed
President Bush's much harder-edged
surge in Iraq.
It's time to end the idealism. How many
times must it fail before we face reality?
Our nation first and foremost must
understand its enemies. Jihadists can-
not be appeased, they do not have
"legitimate grievances," and they mock
and exploit our naïve hopes for their
reform. One does not end jihad by pro-
viding F-16s to the Muslim Brother-
hood or close air support to Syria's
Army of Mujahedeen.
At the same time, however, we must
be careful about our friends. We have to
replace foolish hopes and deadly dreams
with hard-nosed evaluations of action.
Allies such as the Kurds have proven
themselves reliable time and again, and
Egypt's new government has shown
promise in its treatment of Hamas. Yet,
bizarrely, the Obama administration
seems more willing to arm jihadists in
Syria than to arm the Kurdish Peshmerga
in Iraq.
Always-always-we must project
real strength. The people of the Middle
East don't respect weakness and are un-
impressed with kindness when it's com-
bined with weakness. I'll never forget the
frustration and contempt that, during my
own deployment in Iraq, we got from
local villagers when we expressed reluc-
tance to raid a mosque housing a known
jihadist terror cell. They were utterly un-
impressed with our attempts to respect
their faith, and instead received the mes-
sage that only the jihadists had a true com-
mitment to victory.
In the Middle East, idealism leads to
weakness, and weakness leads not just to
death but also to everlasting contempt.
This is how the world's sole military
superpower becomes a laughingstock
and our citizens pay the price-pawns in
jihadists' deadly games as they jockey
for power and prestige in a region that
respects strength more than it cares about
even the best of our naïve ideals.

The Truth
About Islam
It is not monolithic, unlike
our comforting fiction
-
BY DOUGLAS MURRAY
N his address in early September
regarding a possible strategy against
the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria
(ISIS), President Obama was keen
to stress that the group is "not Islamic."
"The vast majority of ISIL's victims
have been Muslim," he said, using
another acronym by which the group is
known. Also, "No religion condones
the killing of innocents." In saying
this, President Obama stands in a long
line of Western leaders-from both
ends of the political spectrum-who
have repeated a lie that may finally be
falling apart.
For more than a decade, nearly every
politician has been at it. A few days
after 9/11, President George W. Bush
was at the Islamic Center of Wash-
ington reading from the Koran and
proclaiming, "The face of terror is not
the true faith of Islam. That's not what
Islam is all about. Islam is peace." He
kept this up for two full terms. His
U.K. counterpart, Tony Blair, said the
same, as Blair's successor does today.
Last year, when two Islamist fanatics,
screaming about Allah, decapitated a
British soldier on a London street, Prime
Minister David Cameron said, "This
was not just an attack on Britain-and
on our British way of life. It was also a
betrayal of Islam. There is nothing in
Islam that justifies this truly dreadful
act." In mid September, after a British
jihadist beheaded a British hostage in
Syria, Cameron said, "They claim to do
this in the name of Islam. That is non-
sense. Islam is a religion of peace. They
are not Muslims; they are monsters."
The note of truculence is understand-
able. Our leaders are frustrated that they
have to keep saying these things in the
face of new atrocities.

including Bloody Sunday and, most recently,
Islamophilia.

It is possible to sympathize with the
predicament of these leaders, especially
when millions of Muslims are living
in the West. Politicians want to avoid
attacking a belief system held by
more than a billion people worldwide.
And they are also concerned-with
occasional justification-that some
kind of backlash will one day occur
against peaceable Muslims living in
Western countries. But still they have a
problem: Straight-out fictions are harder
to keep up than they used to be. During.
a decade in which our leaders have told
Elsewhere in the West there are
Christian and Jewish as well as Muslim
religious leaders who perpetuate this
myth with a more positive spin. Such
leaders have invested vast expense and
time in a "commitment to interfaith
dialogue." Alongside these stultifying
formalities, and in lieu of agreeing on
anything meaningful (which faiths could
ever agree with one another on their
central tenets?), Jewish and Christian
leaders settle for noting superficial
similarities such as dietary require-
ments while defending Islam against
problems in Islam that Muslims them-
selves must face up to has unfortunate
consequences. For one, it makes it easier
for Islam to avoid having to go through
the process of possibly painful but nec-
essary reform. And in the meantime the
lie only assists the Muslim extremists
who tell their followers, "This is exactly
what we are told to do. Everyone else
is saying it's not there. But it is." And
it also emboldens that growing group
of non-Muslims worldwide who are
beginning, erroneously, to think that
there are no moderate Muslims and
Pretending that there are no problems in Islam that
Muslims themselves must face up to has unfortunate
consequences.
us that Islam is one thing, many people
have been able to read up for them-
selves, have watched the videos of
jihadist atrocities, and know that the
extremists claim, by way of justifica-
tion for their acts, that Islam is quite
another thing.
.
ISIS may seem un-Islamic to Presi-
dent Obama, but to anybody who has
read Islam's core texts, it might appear
to be a fairly straightforward attempt to
create a state based on Mohammed's
instructions as laid down in the Koran,
in hadith, and in Mohammed's own
example. Rather than being a "perver-
sion" of Islam, it is truer to say that the
version of Islam espoused by ISIS,
while undoubtedly the worst possible
interpretation of Islam, and for Mus-
lims and non-Muslims everywhere
obviously the most destructive version
of Islam, is nevertheless a plausible
interpretation of Islam. The extremists
do not get where they do from nowhere.
· The near-total unwillingness to admit
this says far more about us than it does
about our enemies.
.
Of course it has not helped that we
live in an age when almost everyone
has become intent on ignoring any dif-
ferences between world religions.
Even most professional atheists man-

it in with all other religions, thereby
sustaining the pretense that "all reli-
gions" are as bad as one another and

the same.
the alleged "onslaught" of militant
atheists. Of course, one tries to be
polite. But might there be an acceptable.
way to tell the truth? I'll take a stab at
it in what follows.
I'm not sure how familiar many people
reading this are with the central Islamic
texts and the life of Mohammed. But I
hope they are familiar with some, if not
most, of the Bible. I address my re-
marks to believers and atheists alike.
Now the politically acceptable thing
to do is to say that all religions can be
perverted, and I am sure we can all agree
that indeed they can be. We can also
agree that all religions have good and
bad passages in their texts and teach-
ings. But do people think that the history
of Christianity-bloody as it has been-
would have been more bloody or less
bloody if instead of telling his followers
to "turn the other cheek" Jesus had
chopped off his enemies' heads, as
Mohammed was prone to do? What if
instead of telling his followers to end-
lessly forgive one another Jesus had
said, as the Koran does, "When you
meet the unbelievers, smite at their
necks"? It is not solely because they are
monsters that ISIS and similar groups
decapitate people. It is also because they
believe that, as Muslims, they have been
instructed to do so by their religious
texts: Any Western leader worth the
name would at least start to admit this.
Wouldn't he?
As I say, I recognize that this is not
easy. But pretending that there are no
that people who say otherwise are cov-
ering up for some kind of monolithic
death cult.
And there is mounting evidence that
the latter group is growing. Polling across
Europe suggests that attitudes toward
Islam as a whole are hardening. As
Daniel Pipes recently pointed out, in
recent polls, 73 percent of French citi-
zens surveyed view Islam negatively, 70
percent of Germans associate the reli-
gion with fanaticism and radicalism, and
83 percent of Germans associate it with
discrimination against women. How could
they not?
In the meantime, anti-Islamic parties .
are on the rise almost everywhere they
stand because they are seen to be will-
ing to tell a truth in a political climate
filled with people strenuously trying to
deny that truth. Even while our leaders
say that various beheadings, gang
rapes, and the like have "nothing to do
with Islam" (or even that they constitute,
in the words of one recent British home
secretary, "anti-Islamic activity"), our
newspapers are filled with stories-
from abroad and in Western countries-
that belie such assertions. Earlier this
year, Boko Haram stole 300 Christian
schoolgirls in northern Nigeria for the
crime of receiving a non-Islamic edu-
cation, while in Britain, Islamic hard-
liners attempted to take over secular
state schools to instill a hardline inter-
pretation of Islam in British children.

Christians were being chased from their

of 1,400 girls in the British city of

raped by Muslim British men of Paki-
stani origin, with the girls being targeted
precisely because they are white non-

where? Or does it come from a problem
that we must one day tackle?
My own suspicion, having studied
this issue most of my adult life, is that
at some point in the coming years some
outrage or other will make it impossible
for politicians to continue this line.
One problem then will be that they will
have no credibility to speak on the sub-
ject. So let me lay down my copyright-
free blueprint for how some future .
leader might truthfully and sensitively
approach the topic.
Start by privately and then publicly
acknowledging that there is a problem.
Follow it by recognizing that it is a
problem that Muslims worldwide must
address. Do everything possible to stop
support of fundamentalist voices of
any Islamic stripe, however large their
constituency. Then identify genuine
voices of reform within Islam and try
to assist them in overcoming the hur-
dles of their faith, however small their
constituency. While ensuring you do
· not tie our own future to theirs, never-
theless wish these latter people luck.
Then dust off your hands and stress
that it is no concern of ours what Islam
is or is not. Simply emphasize that we
do not like having our citizens be-
headed and will not have our cities
attacked. Highlight that we do not look
with relish on the ethnic and religious
cleansing of whole citizenries any-
where. And stress that we could do
without the diet of anti-Semitic, anti-
Christian, anti-apostate, anti-woman,
and anti-gay rhetoric emanating from
many Muslim leaders, mosques, and
self-appointed community-leadership
groups at home and abroad. Point out
that we will be within our rights to
fight such things at home and else-
where.

With any luck, and a bit of leader-

Hagan
Hiding
The North Carolina senator runs
from her record
BY JOHN HOOD
Raleigh, N.C.
N North Carolina's closely watched
U.S. Senate race between Democrat
Kay Hagan and Republican Thom
Tillis, the former is the incumbent.
But she doesn't sound like it. During their
first televised debate, on September 3,
Hagan devoted most of her energy to
decrying the actions of the state's Re-
publican legislature rather than touting
her own record as a freshman senator. She
repeatedly attacked Tillis, the two-term
speaker of the North Carolina house, for
cutting state taxes rather than appropri-
ating more money for public schools.
"Speaker Tillis has the wrong priorities,"
Hagan said. "At every opportunity, he
has fought for policies that are taking
our state backwards." Viewers tuning in
halfway through the broadcast might
well have thought they were watching a
debate between a confident, incumbent
Republican legislator and a frenetic Demo-
cratic challenger trying to take him out.
In her bid to reframe the race as a ref-
erendum on Republican governance in
Raleigh rather than on Democratic gover-
nance in Washington, Hagan is getting a
lot of help. Within the state, left-leaning
media outlets and interest groups have
gleefully joined her cause in hopes of
weakening or perhaps even overturning
the GOP majority in the legislature. Out-
side the state, liberal commentators and
activists are enthralled by an NAACP-led
political movement called Moral Mon-
days that advocates a range of "social jus-
tice" issues. Originating as regular weekly
protests at North Carolina's legislative
building, the movement turned into mass
rallies that attracted copious media cover-
age by the likes of MSNBC and the New
York Times. Liberals would love to see it
replicated across the country as a model
for Democratic mobilization. They be-

Foundation, a public-policy think tank based in

lieve that if Thom Tillis, one of the leg-
islative leaders targeted by Moral Mon-
day protests, loses one of the nation's
most watched Senate races in 2014, it
would give the movement momentum in' :
other states.
Many Republicans and conservatives
also see the Hagan-Tillis race as more
than just another battle in the nationwide
contest to control the U.S. Senate. Since
2010, when Republicans won both of the
state's legislative chambers, for the first
time since Reconstruction, North Caro-
lina has become one of the Right's new
success stories-a state where a new gen-
eration of leaders has enacted sweeping
· tax reform, lightened the state's regula-
tory burden, reformed its tort system,
limited entitlements, embraced school
choice, phased out teacher tenure, priva-
tized services, and championed many
other longtime conservative causes. While
most of these initiatives had precedents,
no state has advanced so many so far in
so short a period of time.
Governors and legislatures now occupy
a central place in the national debate about
how best to foster economic growth.
Many conservatives cite the sizzling.
economy of Texas as proof that smaller,
market-friendly government is best. In
response, the Left points to Wisconsin
and Kansas as states where, they allege,
Republican leaders oversold the benefits
of conservative reform and now face sub-
par economic growth.
Although these matters are best judged
over the long run, North Carolina's expe-
rience to date strengthens the conserva-
tive side of the argument. Since the first
round of fiscal and regulatory policies
crafted by Thom Tillis and his colleagues
went into effect in mid 2011, North
Carolina payrolls have grown by more
than 220,000-a job-creation rate higher
than the national average and higher than
the rate in every other southeastern state
except Florida. North Carolina's GDP
growth has also outpaced regional and
national averages. And North Carolina's
U-5 unemployment rate-a statistic that
includes workers who've dropped out of
the labor force-is now 8.1 percent,
equal to the national average and down
dramatically from mid 2011, when the
state's 11.9 percent rate was one of the
highest in the country.
In his campaign appearances and TV
ads, Thom Tillis is hardly running away
from his legislative record. He's proud of

it. Hagan and her allies have resorted to
concocting such absurd claims-that the
Republicans raised taxes on 80 percent of
North Carolinians, for example, or cut
education spending by half a billion dol-
lars -. that even fact-checkers for the Wash-
ington Post and left-leaning outfits have
judged them false. Over the four years
Tillis has led the state house, general-fund
appropriations for public education have
risen nearly $1 billion, at a pace more
than sufficient to keep up with inflation
and enrollment. And large tax cuts in 2011
and 2013 left a majority of North Caro-
lina households at every income level
with a lower tax burden.
While Hagan seems desperate to talk
about anything except her own service in
the Senate, Tillis mixes a spirited defense
of his significant accomplishments in
North Carolina with a bracing attack on
Hagan's lack of significant accomplish-
ments in Washington. Six years ago,
Hagan beat Elizabeth Dole in part by
describing her as a rubber stamp for
George W. Bush. In one of the most
colorful ads of the 2008 cycle, a group
supporting Hagan put two elderly actors
in rocking chairs debating whether Dole
was "92" or "93." While nominally about
how often Dole sided with Bush in floor
votes and how low she ranked in Senate
effectiveness, the ad in reality was a not-
so-subtle dig at Dole's age. "She's just
not a go-getter like you and me," one of
the old men quipped to the other.
Turnabout is fair play. It happens that
Senator Hagan has voted with Obama's
position 95 percent of the time, a fact that
Tillis and anti-Hagan groups are remind-
ing voters of at every opportunity. "The
only independence I've seen from Kay
Hagan in six years is independence from
the citizens of North Carolina," Tillis
said in their debate. Although the presi-
dent is only slightly more unpopular in
this swing state than in the country as a
whole, that's bad enough. Hagan has
answered the charge by describing herself
as one of the most moderate Democratic
senators-which in today's polarized
Senate isn't saying much-and by, once
again, attempting to change the subject
back to the state legislature.
AP PHOTO/GERRY BROOME, POOL
There's no question that the past four
years of conservative reform in North
Carolina have brought controversy, often-
hostile media coverage, and political
challenges for GOP legislators. The
state's Democratic base is outraged. At
Democrat Kay Hagan
the same time, many Republican voters
remain unaware of what their representa-
tives have achieved. Speaking last fall at a
GOP luncheon in one of the state's red-
dest counties, I discussed the virtues of
restructuring the income-tax code and
suggested the flat tax as a model for fed-
eral reform. "Do you think something like
that could ever be done here in North
Carolina?" asked one of the frustrated tea-
party activists in attendance. She got a
round of applause. This was after the state
legislature had already adopted a flat tax.
Conditioned to expect that their repre-
sentatives in Washington will flail about
ineffectually, many Republican voters in
North Carolina are still getting used to
the idea that their state lawmakers might
actually accomplish something. In recent
Gallup polling, North Carolinians as a
whole were less supportive of their state
government than were their counterparts
in the rest of the country. More than a
third of Tar Heel Republicans expressed
"not very much" or "no" confidence in
their state government's ability to handle
state problems.
Republican leaders, Tillis included,
haven't always communicated effectively
with independent voters or even their
own base. The headache for Hagan, how-
ever, is that her duel with Tillis is unlikely
to be fought on the ground she prefers.
North Carolinians aren't electing some-
one to legislate in Raleigh, as Hagan did
for several terms as a state senator. They
are electing someone to address the na-
tion's problems in Washington. Hagan's
votes for Obamacare, tax hikes, and tril-
lions of dollars in federal debt are unpop-
ular here. Furthermore, polls show that
national security is once again becoming
an important voting issue in North Caro-
lina, home to one of the country's largest
populations of active-duty and retired
military members. In 2008, Hagan cam-
paigned for the votes of veterans by
Republican Thom Tillis
promising to improve VA hospitals. The
recent scandal within the VA system has
been yet another embarrassment for
her-and another good subject for attack
ads by pro-Tillis groups.
Still, it would be foolish to count
Hagan out. In North Carolina, the shares
of voters who identify themselves as
Democrats and Republicans are roughly
even, in the low 40s. That's also where
Hagan and Tillis are in public surveys,
with Hagan about three points up, on
average. Libertarian candidate Sean
Haugh has sometimes polled in the high
single digits. Although his support will
decline by Election Day, Haugh is dis-
proportionately pulling potential voters
from Tillis. Moreover, Hagan and her
allies are outspending Tillis and his allies.
The Wesleyan Media Project reports
that the candidates and independent-
expenditure groups together had by late
August already spent more than $25
million to run some 45,000 TV spots,
plus millions more on radio, mailers,
websites, and voter mobilization. North
Carolina will probably host the nation's
most expensive Senate race in 2014-
some project that the final tally will be
upward of $75 million-and it has a his-
tory of last-minute electoral swings.
Admittedly, the campaign is devoid of
the larger-than-life characters that have
often populated North Carolina Senate
races. Thom Tillis is no Jesse Helms.
Kay Hagan is no John Edwards (thank
goodness). But the matchup remains
fascinating as a chaotic, hard-to-predict
contest with implications not only for
Obama's last two years in office but also
for the fate of conservative governance
more generally. Advancing a reform
agenda in Congress will require more
conservative members who have real
experience translating abstract ideas
into practical policies. You'll find them
in the states.

The Truth About Islam
Douglas Murray
National Review
6 October 2014
It is not monolithic, unlike our comforting fiction.
IN his address in early September regarding a possible strategy against the Islamic State in Iraq
and Syria (ISIS), President Obama was keen to stress that the group is "not Islamic." "The vast
majority of ISIL's victims have been Muslim," he said, using another acronym by which the
group is known. Also, "No religion condones the killing of innocents." In saying this, President
Obama stands in a long line of Western leaders-from both ends of the political spectrum-
who have repeated a lie that may finally be falling apart.
For more than a decade, nearly every politician has been at it. A few days after 9/11, President
George W. Bush was at the Islamic Center of Washington reading from the Koran and
proclaiming, "The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam. That's not what Islam is all about.
Islam is peace." He kept this up for two full terms. His U.K. counterpart, Tony Blair, said the
same, as Blair's successor does today. Last year, when two Islamist fanatics, screaming about
Allah, decapitated a British soldier on a London street, Prime Minister David Cameron said,
"This was not just an attack on Britain-and on our British way of life. It was also a betrayal of
Islam. There is nothing in Islam that justifies this truly dreadful act." In mid September, after a
British jihadist beheaded a British hostage in Syria, Cameron said, "They claim to do this in the
name of Islam. That is nonsense. Islam is a religion of peace. They are not Muslims; they are
monsters." The note of truculence is understandable. Our leaders are frustrated that they have
to keep saying these things in the face of new atrocities.
It is possible to sympathize with the predicament of these leaders, especially when millions of
Muslims are living in the West. Politicians want to avoid attacking a belief system held by more
than a billion people worldwide. And they are also concerned-with occasional justification-
that some kind of backlash will one day occur against peaceable Muslims living in Western
countries. But still they have a problem: Straight-out fictions are harder to keep up than they
used to be. During a decade in which our leaders have told us that Islam is one thing, many
people have been able to read up for themselves, have watched the videos of jihadist atrocities,
and know that the extremists claim, by way of justification for their acts, that Islam is quite
another thing.
ISIS may seem un-Islamic to President Obama, but to anybody who has read Islam's core texts,
it might appear to be a fairly straightforward attempt to create a state based on Mohammed's
instructions as laid down in the Koran, in hadith, and in Mohammed's own example. Rather
than being a "perversion" of Islam, it is truer to say that the version of Islam espoused by ISIS,
while undoubtedly the worst possible interpretation of Islam, and for Muslims and non-
Muslims everywhere obviously the most destructive version of Islam, is nevertheless a plausible
interpretation of Islam. The extremists do not get where they do from nowhere. The near-total
unwillingness to admit this says far more about us than it does about our enemies.
Of course it has not helped that we live in an age when almost everyone has become intent on
ignoring any differences between world religions. Even most professional atheists manage to
criticize Islam only by lumping it in with all other religions, thereby sustaining the pretense that
"all religions" are as bad as one another and are everywhere and always essentially the same.
Elsewhere in the West there are Christian and Jewish as well as Muslim religious leaders who
perpetuate this myth with a more positive spin. Such leaders have invested vast expense and
time in a "commitment to interfaith dialogue." Alongside these stultifying formalities, and in
lieu of agreeing on anything meaningful (which faiths could ever agree with one another on
their central tenets?), Jewish and Christian leaders settle for noting superficial similarities such
as dietary requirements while defending Islam against the alleged "onslaught" of militant
atheists. Of course, one tries to be polite. But might there be an acceptable way to tell the
truth? I'll take a stab at it in what follows.
I'm not sure how familiar many people reading this are with the central Islamic texts and the
life of Mohammed. But I hope they are familiar with some, if not most, of the Bible. I address
my remarks to believers and atheists alike.
Now the politically acceptable thing to do is to say that all religions can be perverted, and I am
sure we can all agree that indeed they can be. We can also agree that all religions have good
and bad passages in their texts and teachings. But do people think that the history of
Christianity-bloody as it has been-would have been more bloody or less bloody if instead of
telling his followers to "turn the other cheek" Jesus had chopped off his enemies' heads, as
Mohammed was prone to do? What if instead of telling his followers to endlessly forgive one
another Jesus had said, as the Koran does, "When you meet the unbelievers, smite at their
necks"? It is not solely because they are monsters that ISIS and similar groups decapitate
people. It is also because they believe that, as Muslims, they have been instructed to do so by
their religious texts. Any Western leader worth the name would at least start to admit this.
Wouldn't he?
As I say, I recognize that this is not easy. But pretending that there are no problems in Islam
that Muslims themselves must face up to has unfortunate consequences. For one, it makes it
easier for Islam to avoid having to go through the process of possibly painful but necessary
reform. And in the meantime the lie only assists the Muslim extremists who tell their followers,
"This is exactly what we are told to do. Everyone else is saying it's not there. But it is." And it
also emboldens that growing group of non-Muslims worldwide who are beginning, erroneously,
to think that there are no moderate Muslims and that people who say otherwise are covering
up for some kind of monolithic death cult.
And there is mounting evidence that the latter group is growing. Polling across Europe suggests
that attitudes toward Islam as a whole are hardening. As Daniel Pipes recently pointed out, in

recent polls, 73 percent of French citizens surveyed view Islam negatively, 70 percent of
Germans associate the religion with fanaticism and radicalism, and 83 percent of Germans
associate it with discrimination against women. How could they not?
In the meantime, anti-Islamic parties are on the rise almost everywhere they stand because
they are seen to be willing to tell a truth in a political climate filled with people strenuously
trying to deny that truth. Even while our leaders say that various beheadings, gang rapes, and
the like have "nothing to do with Islam" (or even that they constitute, in the words of one
recent British home secretary, "anti-Islamic activity"), our newspapers are filled with stories-
from abroad and in Western countries-that belie such assertions. Earlier this year, Boko
Haram stole 300 Christian schoolgirls in northern Nigeria for the crime of receiving a non-
Islamic education, while in Britain, Islamic hardliners attempted to take over secular state
schools to instill a hardline interpretation of Islam in British children.
A few months later, as Yazidis and Christians were being chased from their houses by ISIS
militias telling them to convert to Islam or be killed, we read of 1,400 girls in the British city of
Rotherham being trafficked and gang-raped by Muslim British men of Pakistani origin, with the
. girls being targeted precisely because they are white non-Muslims. Does this all come from
nowhere? Or does it come from a problem that we must one day tackle?
My own suspicion, having studied this issue most of my adult life, is that at some point in the
coming years some outrage or other will make it impossible for politicians to continue this line.
One problem then will be that they will have no credibility to speak on the subject. So let me lay
down my copyrightfree blueprint for how some future leader might truthfully and sensitively
approach the topic.
Start by privately and then publicly acknowledging that there is a problem. Follow it by
recognizing that it is a problem that Muslims worldwide must address. Do everything possible
to stop support of fundamentalist voices of any Islamic stripe, however large their constituency.
Then identify genuine voices of reform within Islam and try to assist them in overcoming the
hurdles of their faith, however small their constituency. While ensuring you do not tie our own
future to theirs, nevertheless wish these latter people luck.
Then dust off your hands and stress that it is no concern of ours what Islam is or is not. Simply
emphasize that we do not like having our citizens beheaded and will not have our cities
attacked. Highlight that we do not look with relish on the ethnic and religious cleansing of
whole citizenries anywhere. And stress that we could do without the diet of anti-Semitic,
antiChristian, anti-apostate, anti-woman, and anti-gay rhetoric emanating from many Muslim
leaders, mosques, and self-appointed community-leadership groups at home and abroad. Point
out that we will be within our rights to fight such things at home and elsewhere.
With any luck, and a bit of leadership, ISIS will not be long for this world. But if they are
remembered for any lasting contribution, it may be their part in blowing apart one of the
politest but most fallacious myths of our time.

Is the Islamic State Islamic?
Robert Reilly
Liberty Law Forum
14 October 2014
Nothing could be more curious to Muslims than Western non-Muslims telling them what their religion is
about. Would not Christians find it odd to hear from Muslims what the true meaning of their religion is?
Nevertheless, after almost every terrorist act against a Westerner, particularly the more gruesome ones
like beheadings, Western heads of state reflexively react with protestations that such acts are absolutely
un-Islamic, despite the explicit claims of their perpetrators that they are done precisely as religious acts,
as they exultantly declare, "Allahu Akbar."
For example, President Barack Obama and Prime Minister David Cameron, noted Muslim scholars both,
were the first to assure us that the Islamic State or ISIS, after it had decapitated an American and a
British citizen, has nothing to do with Islam. (Of course, we can trace the genealogy of this thinking at
least back to former President George W. Bush who said, after 9/11, "The face of terror is not the true
faith of Islam. . . Islam is peace.) Their subalterns also chimed in. Secretary of State John Kerry
announced that Islam is a "peaceful religion based on the dignity of all human beings." He denounced
the Islamic State as "this enemy of Islam." U.K. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond asserted that the
Islamic State "goes against the most basic beliefs of Islam."
Clerics were not far behind. The Archbishop of Brisbane, Australia, Mark Coleridge said, "It has nothing
to do with real Islam." At a September press conference, retired Cardinal Theodore McCarrick claimed
that "Catholic social teaching is based on the dignity of the human person . . . [and] as you study the holy
Koran, as you study Islam, basically, this is what Muhammad the prophet, peace be upon him, has been
teaching." Therefore, these killings were not canonically correct. So they must not be due to Islam, but
to a lack of opportunity-something we can fix.
This sort of exculpation happens so frequently that I can only understand it as a kind of preemptive
Stockholm Syndrome. Because we don't want to face the consequences if such acts are Islamic, we will
simply insist that they are not: they can't be because we find that unacceptable. The preemptive
Stockholm Syndrome not only provides huge psychological relief to us, but it also lets Islam off the hook.
Why don't we wait to hear from Muslims on this? Wouldn't they be in a better position to say? In
Jordan, politician Muhammad Bayoudh Al-Tamimi, a Palestinian, adamantly defended ISIS during a
television appearance posted online in late August. Islamic State ideology "stems from the Quran and
the Sunna," he said, according to the translation by the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI).
"The Quran and the Sunna constitute their ideology, doctrine, and conduct. ... There is no such thing as
'ISIS ideology'-it's Islam."
That of course supports the position of ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, who has declared himself
caliph and claims descent from Mohammed. Unlike Obama and Cameron, he has a PhD in Islamic
studies. As any good caliph would, he has commanded the allegiance of all Muslims in order that they
might reclaim their "dignity, might, rights and leadership," and announced that ISIS would march on
Rome. If he is a real caliph, there is nothing particularly unorthodox about this, and it would resonate
with a desire in the hearts of many Muslims.
--
"We look forward to the coming, as soon as possible, of the caliphate," said Yusuf al-Qaradawi, the most
popular preacher and scholar in the Sunni Muslim world. However, he cautioned, the "declaration
issued by the Islamic State is void under sharia and has dangerous consequences for the Sunnis in Iraq
and for the revolt in Syria," adding that the title of caliph can "only be given by the entire Muslim
nation," not by a single group.
So the problem is not with the idea of the caliphate, but with this particular pretender to the title.
However, as the long history of Islam has shown, power is self-legitimating in the Muslim world. Power
comes from Allah; otherwise, how could one have it? Therefore, further success in battle and more
oaths of allegiance from other Muslim groups may vindicate Al-Baghdadi's claim. That is why Muslim
rulers, particularly in the Middle East, are particularly anxious that he be defeated. Otherwise, their
goose is cooked.
This is essentially a Muslim quarrel. In fact, the Muslim opponents of ISIS refer to its members as
Kharijites, referring to a 7th century intramural conflict over the caliphate that was likewise settled with
a great deal of blood.
However, we in the West are unlikely to hear of the struggle in these terms. More likely, we are
assuaged by statements like that made in August by former Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir
Mohamad, who said: "There is no place for violence in Islam. Islam is a religion of peace and some
people have wrongly interpreted the religion." No doubt, and there have been many such protestations
from Muslim leaders and religious figures.
But how is peace defined in Islam? The key is to understand the Islamic jurisprudential context in which
these things are said. I have no doubt of the sincerity of most Muslim leaders in saying the things they
do, but we in the West are largely unaware of what they mean by what they say. This is due to our
ignorance of Islam.
The goal of Islam is salam, which means peace in Arabic. However, ultimate peace is achieved only by
bringing all things into submission to Allah. That submission is often signified by the rule of Sharia. How
is that to be done, especially if, as Dr. Muzammil Siddiqi, an Indian American Muslim, has said,
"aggression is never allowed in matters of faith"? Westerners could only wish this were so. But it
decidedly is not-except in the most literal way in which Sharia defines as aggressors those who refuse to
accept Islam.
In classical Islamic jurisprudence, after Islam has been offered to non-Muslim states or entities three
times, their refusal to accept it makes them the aggressor (taghout). Anything that inhibits the spread of
Islam is considered a hostile act insofar as it contradicts the will of Allah that "the word of Allah be
supreme in the world," and hence a casus belli. (I have little doubt that James Foley, David Haines, and
the other executed Westerners were first offered Islam by their captors, then killed only after their
refusal. If they had accepted Islam, they could not have been beheaded according to the Islamic rules of
the game.)

Waging this kind of offensive jihad (jihad al-talab waal-ibtida) was an obligation of the caliph or
"commander of the faithful" at least once a year, conditions permitting. There is definitely a
jurisprudence of jihad-a kind of Islamic just war teaching-that requires prudential considerations of likely
success and proper authority before jihad can be declared. Hence some of the objections to Al-

Baghdadi. However, the obligation to jihad is incontestable, which is why it is called the sixth pillar of
Islam.
Also, Muslims did not use the word harb (war) to describe their consequent armed assaults, but jihad
and considered them "openings" (futuhat) of the world to Islam. It is those who resist Islam who are
waging harb. Therefore, Dr. Siddiqui, who earned a graduate degree in Arabic and Islamic Studies at the
Islamic University of Medina in Saudi Arabia, is literally correct in saying that "aggression is never
allowed," but only through the legerdemain of Sharia which defines defense against Islam as aggression.
How many, however, who hear and are comforted by these kinds of declarations of the nonviolent
nature of Islam understand the Islamic jurisprudence of peace-which defines defense as offense?
These kinds of contextual misunderstandings can, in my view, be extended to the horrific matter of
beheadings. Secretary of State Kerry proclaimed, "There's nothing in Islam that condones or suggests
people should . .. cut people's heads off." Actually, the argument within Islam is not over the justice or
injustice of this act but over who should be subjected to it, for what reasons, and when. Beheading itself
is sanctioned in Muslim revelation. So there is nothing wrong with it in principle, which is why there are
so many beheadings in Saudi Arabia each year.
The Quran says: "When you encounter the unbelievers on the battlefield, strike off their heads until you
have crushed them completely; then bind the prisoners tightly." (47:4) And also: "I will cast dread into
the hearts of the unbelievers. Strike off their heads, then, and strike off all of their fingertips." (8:12). It
is only a matter of prudence as to when and on whom to apply this punishment.
Here is the basic problem-the hard truth regarding these issues that we are too afraid to recognize. The
well-known Egyptian scholar, the late Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd, noted:
If we follow the rules of interpretation developed from the classical "science of Koranic
interpretation," it is not possible to condemn terrorism in religious terms. It remains completely true to
the classical rules in its evolution of sanctity for its own justification. This is where the secret of its
theological strength lies.
This is why the denunciations of terrorism by Muslims are frequently hedged. You will be able to
recognize the hedges only if you know Islamic jurisprudence.
Yes, the possibility may exist of historicizing these texts-that is, confining them to their time and place in
the 7th century - and some honorable and courageous Muslims I know have been working on this. (In
fact, Nasr Abu Zayd was declared an apostate and driven out of Egypt for doing this kind of work.) But
many others insist on their literal interpretation and application.
I think that so long as the main theology of Islam, which is Ash'arism, posits a God of pure will and
power, it will not be able to get out of the grip of violence and the religious justification for it. So long as
it can't, one has to say that Islamism is a true interpretation of Islam insofar as Islam is not able to resist
it. And I don't mean resist by force of arms, but theologically. Islam currently does not have sufficient
antibodies, and Western medicine has nothing to offer-because the problem is fundamentally religious.
The State Department's new Undersecretary for Public Diplomacy, Rick Stengel, said in a recent speech
that there is no battle of ideas with ISIL. ISIL is bereft of ideas, they're bankrupt of ideas. It's not an
organization that is animated by ideas. It's a criminal, savage, barbaric organization.
This is hugely mistaken. It's giving up while sounding tough. Once again, Islam gets a free pass. It is not
enough for the West to call these people barbarians. Recall that Adolph Hitler exclaimed, "We are
barbarians. We want to be barbarians. It is an honorable title." Calling him a barbarian was useless. In
the Nazi case, it was the ideology that made barbarism honorable that had to be attacked in a war of
ideas. With ISIS, we must object not only to their barbaric acts but to the Quranic principles that inspire
and justify them.
It is time to stop the whitewashing and call them out on it. Doing so would be the single most effective
thing we could do to help reformers in the Muslim world-and to help ourselves, as well. Otherwise, our
exculpatory reflex will keep us in denial and enable the very forces in Islam that are against reform.
